1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Selector groups are CSS rules containing 2 or more comma separated selectors

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,930
that shared the same properties and values.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,640
So we give the same styles to several types of selectors all at once.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,180
Doing this minimizes our CSS and makes it more maintainable 

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,270
because we're not unnecessarily repeating lines of code.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,220
Let's find out how.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,200
So here we have an HTML document containing 3 DIVs

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,590
each with a different class.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,880
So here we have a square, circle, and ellipse.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:42,640
Over in our style.css file, I've already created a CSS rule for each selector

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,550
where I've defined a few styles to set the shape of each element.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,750
Again, don't worry if you're not familiar 

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,330
with many of these properties and values just yet

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,230
because we'll be covering them throughout this Deep Dive.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,200
For this video, you'll simply need to understand how grouping selectors

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,800
can help us keep our CSS to a minimum and make things more maintainable for us.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,810
In the browser, we can see each shape that was defined in the style sheet.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,640
So here we have the square, the circle, and the ellipse.

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,860
In our CSS file, notice how each of these rules 

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,980
have certain CSS properties in common.

21
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,620
They share certain styles in order to define their shapes.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,800
So for example, all 3 rules have the same exact value for display 

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,380
with margin and background color.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,840
The circle and ellipse selectors also share the same border, radius, values.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,790
So we're repeating a lot of CSS in these 3 rules.

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,680
There's a common practice in CSS or in web development in general called dry

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,960
which stands for don't repeat yourself

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,590
and the main idea is to avoid repeating the same bits of code.

29
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,910
So if we have code that is repeated multiple times throughout the style sheet

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,540
like we have in our 3 selectors here, it's a good idea to refactor the CSS 

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,770
so that each property and value pair is only defined one time.

32
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,420
I'll show what I mean.

33
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,900
So the idea with dry is to group repeated CSS properties together.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,160
So we know that all 3 rules share the same values for display 

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,420
with margin and background color. 

36
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:57,440
So what we'll do is add the circle and ellipse class selectors to this first rule.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,100
Even though the ellipse rule doesn't share the same height property 

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,050
as we can see here it has a height of 120 pixels, 

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,860
we'll still add it to this top rule because we'll modify 

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,880
the height in the ellipse rule so it's fine.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,570
So up here, we'll go ahead and add a coma followed by circle, 

42
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,290
then another coma and we'll type ellipse.

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,580
It's important that we add the coma between every selector we're grouping 

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,100
except for the very last one.

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,320
Otherwise, the entire rule will be ignored by the browser.

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,640
So now we can go ahead and remove those repeated 

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,990
properties from the circle and ellipse selectors 

48
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,400
because they're already defined in the top rule.

49
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,950
So, next, we can group circle and ellipse into a selector 

50
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,070
since they both share the same border radius value

51
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,830
which simply sets the rounded corners and circular shape.

52
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,140
So I'll go ahead and add a coma after circle then type ellipse.

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,860
So now, we can go ahead and remove the border radius decoration from

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,000
 the ellipse rule and leave the modified height of 120 pixels.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,950
Okay, so we'll go ahead and save the style sheet

56
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,950
 and I'll bring up the Chrome browser.

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,320
When I refresh it, we can see that nothing has changed.

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,960
Everything looks exactly the same

59
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,300
except that our CSS is now much cleaner or drier.

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,570
We can actually take things a step further and turn these CSS rules into modules

61
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,440
 or components that can be reused anywhere in our HTML

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,420
I'll show you what I mean by that.

63
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,470
So instead of the finding, 3 separate selectors for this top rule, 

64
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,990
we can make this one CSS class selector. 

65
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,050
We'll need to give it a new class name and since class name should 

66
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,610
always be meaningful and clearly communicate what they do, 

67
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,670
I'll go ahead and name this one base

68
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,200
 because it defines the base styles for our shapes.

69
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,180
Next, we can do the same thing for the second selector group

70
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,670
this time we'll name it radius since it defines the border radius of the shape.

71
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,720
We can keep the ellipse selector since it's defining

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,250
 the elliptical shape with it's smaller height value.

73
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,140
So I'll save the CSS file and we'll go over to our index.html file 

74
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,960
So we know that classes are reusable and that 

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,750
an element can have more than one class. 

76
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,360
So what we'll need to do next is replace these classes 

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,520
with the new selectors we just created.

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,610
We'll sort of plug those little modules in wherever necessary. 

79
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,240
So first, we'll replace each class with base.

80
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
Let's go ahead and copy paste this in here.

81
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,250
So I'll save this and in the browser when we refresh it, 

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,180
we get 3 squares for all 3 

83
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,700
because a square is the base shape for styles.

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,590
So back in our CSS, I'll go ahead and plug in the radius class 

85
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,470
for our circle element in order to add the border radius.

86
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,120
So below this in our elliptical element, 

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,610
we'll also need to add the radius class since it does need the border radius value

88
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,850
then we'll need to add the ellipse class to modify the type.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,650
So I'll go ahead and save the HTML file.

90
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,800
When we review it in the browser, we can see how

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,340
 everything looks and works exactly the same.

92
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,440
but now our CSS is much more efficient and maintainable 

93
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,650
compared to the CSS we started with.

94
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,090
So as we can see here in our original CSS file, 

95
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,470
we've significantly reduced the lines of CSS code in our style sheet.
