1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Classes and IDs allow us to specifically target elements 

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,210
based on their class or ID attributes.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,220
The main difference between a class and ID is that IDs are unique 

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,500
and they're used to identify one element on a page.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,980
Whereas a class can be used to classify and target more than one element.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,080
So first up let's talk about selecting elements with CSS class selectors.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,240
A class selector targets an element based on its class attribute.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,990
So in our HTML file, let's go ahead and add 

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,720
class attributes and values to some of our elements.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,200
We'll then create a few styles for them in our style sheet

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,250
because currently our page has no author styles applied.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,610
So in our HTML file, we'll start with the first DIV in the document.

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,380
So we'll go ahead and give it a class attribute

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,870
 followed by an = sign and a set of quotation marks.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,500
Now naming the class is up to us and it's usually good practice to give classes

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,520
 meaningful names that explain what they do and what their purpose is.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:19,670
Because this DIV contains or wraps the other elements in the document,

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,750
we'll go ahead and give it a class name container.

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:30,470
So we'll save our HTML file and we'll go into our style.css file 

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,340
where we'll need to create the class selector or container.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,080
Classes are defined by using the dot character followed by the class name.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,490
So we'll first type a dot followed by container and a set of curly braces.

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,230
We'll then create a few styles for our new container class.

24
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,780
So I'll give it a width property with the value 740 pixels 

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,550
followed by a margin property and the value auto

26
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,160
which will center our DIV element on the page.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,690
So when we save our CSS file and refresh the browser, 

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,920
we see the width of the container element reduced to 740 pixels 

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,760
and it's now centered in the browser.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,060
So next, let's add a class to our header elements.

31
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,960
Now we could may be just use this header element type selector to select it 

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,720
but let's instead give it the class name name header

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,480
because again, we'll want to give it a meaningful class name

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,320
and since we know this will always be the main header in our page 

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,790
or website, the main header class name communicates that very clearly.

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,660
So we'll go ahead and type name-header

37
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,990
So we'll save the HTML file and go back into the style sheet 

38
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,190
where we'll need to create the class selector for main-header.

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,290
So again, I'll type a dot followed by main-header and a set of curly braces 

40
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,310
then I will give it a height property with a value of 110 pixels 

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,480
followed by color white and finally--

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,930
a background property with the value royal blue.

43
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,920
So when we save the style sheet and refresh our browser,

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,220
we can see that our header is now 110 pixels tall, 

45
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,170
the text color is white, and the background is royal blue.

46
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,380
Back in our HTML file, let's add a class attribute

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,200
 to the next DIV element in the document

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,640
and we'll go ahead and give it the value main-content.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,470
I'm giving it the class name main-content because the DIV contains

50
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,630
 the main content on the page like headings and paragraphs.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,630
So in our style.css file, I'll create the selector for main-content 

52
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,320
and I will give it a padding property with the value of 20 pixels 

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,190
and a background value of light gray. 

54
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,190
So I'll save the style sheet and when we refresh the browser, 

55
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,570
we see that light gray background and the 20 pixels of padding 

56
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,920
separating the content from the edges of the DIV.

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,240
Finally, let's add a class to our footer element.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,020
We'll give it the class name name footer because again

59
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,280
like main header, it's a meaningful class name 

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,090
since this will always be the main footer in our page.

61
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,330
So we'll save our HTML file and in our style sheet,

62
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,860
we'll create our class selector for main-footer.

63
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,220
I will give it a height of 100 pixels, a text color of white,

64
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,710
and I will give it a background value with the shade of black.

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,740
So when we save our style sheet and refresh the browser,

66
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,710
there we see our new footer styles.

67
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,340
CSS class selectors are very useful

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,480
 because they can be reused throughout a page.

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
So multiple elements can share the same class 

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,060
and an element can also have multiple classes applied to it.

71
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,540
So for example, let's create a new class selector named base

72
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,620
where I will give it some top padding. 

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,980
I'll also make the text color white.

74
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:07,250
I'll align the text center and give it a font size of 24 pixels.

75
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,260
So I'll save this style sheet and go into our HTML file 

76
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,270
where we then add the new base class value to any of these classes.

77
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,890
We'll just need to separate them with a space.

78
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,270
So we'll go ahead and add it to the main_header and main-footer values.

79
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,690
So again, I will just add a space followed by base 

80
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,280
and in our footer, I will add a space followed by base.

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,370
When we save our HTML file and refresh the browser, 

82
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,590
there we see those new base styles applied to the header and the footer.

83
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,040
So it applies those new styles on top of the ones they already have.

84
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,040
Like with type selectors, we can also create descended selectors with classes.

85
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:05,380
So for example in our CSS file, I will select main-content.

86
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,970
I will follow it with a space then select every paragraph inside main_content

87
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:21,240
where I will give them a font size of 21 pixels and a line height of 1.5

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,000
 and a margin top value of 32 pixels.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,850
When we save the style sheets and review it in the browser,

90
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,060
I'll click refresh, we can see how the paragraph text is much larger 

91
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,100
and the line of texts are spaced out with the line height and margins.

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,380
So next, let's talk about ID selectors.

93
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,970
An ID selector targets an element based on its ID attribute.

94
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:58,720
What makes IDs different from classes is that IDs are unique to the page.

95
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,330
So an element can only have one ID 

96
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,570
and a page can only have one element with the same ID name.

97
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,020
So in our HTML file, let's go ahead and change this name 

98
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,380
content + attribute in our mark up here to an ID attribute.

99
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,070
So now, because our DIV already had an ID applied,

100
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:31,530
we can no longer add IDs to it and we cannot use this main-content ID

101
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,490
 anywhere else in this HTML file like we could with classes.

102
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,630
So I'll save our HTML file and next, we'll need to change our CSS selector.

103
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,170
ID selectors are created by using the # symbol.

104
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,950
So in our style sheet, we'll just need to switch 

105
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,030
the period in our selector here with the # symbol.

106
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,940
So when we save this and refresh the browser, notice how the

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,670
 main_content DIV element still has its padding and background styles applied.

108
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,230
The paragraphs, however, have lost their font size, line height, and margins

109
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,930
because we've changed their parent element to an ID.

110
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,050
So in our style sheet, we'll simply need to adjust this descended selector

111
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,160
by changing the main-content class selector to an ID.

112
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,590
So now when we refresh, our paragraphs are once again 

113
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,170
styled with the larger font size, line height, and top margins.

114
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,490
We can apply both a class and an ID to an element

115
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,750
but keep in mind that IDs carry more specificity than classes do.

116
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,000
So if an element has an ID and a class applied, 

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,640
the styles defined in the ID selector will always carry more weight 

118
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,700
than the styles defined in the class selector.

119
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,180
So we'll need to make sure we don't share properties between classes and IDs.

120
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,790
IDs also have browser functionality .

121
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,830
They can be used as what are called fragment identifiers

122
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,850
 for creating landmarks or anchors in pages.

123
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,330
I'll show you what I mean.

124
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,600
So if we give the header at the top of our page here an ID attribute

125
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,760
and the value top, then at the very bottom of the page, 

126
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:46,080
we'll go ahead and add a link and we will give it an HREF value of #top.

127
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,170
Whenever we click on a link with an HREF value of #top,

128
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,260
the browser will locate the element with the ID of top

129
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,760
and it will jump right to that section of the page.

130
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,150
So for the sake of this example, I'll go ahead and increase

131
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,150
 the height of our main-content DIV to about 800 pixels.

132
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,050
So we can really see how this works.

133
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,890
So when I save both files and refresh the browser, 

134
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,690
notice how our height has been extended 

135
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,870
and when we scroll down and click our back to top link here,

136
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,930
the browser takes us right back up to the top of the page

137
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,930
because we've instructed it to find the element with the ID of top

138
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,720
which in our case is the header.
