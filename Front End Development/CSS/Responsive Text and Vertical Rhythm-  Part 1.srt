[Web Typography: Responsive Text and Vertical Rhythm Part 1 with Guil Hernandez]

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,140
[Guil Hernandez]: As we've just learned, 

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,160
the web has caught up with typography in a remarkable way,

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,600
and it has become a rapidly evolving area of CSS.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
But good web typography

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,470
is also knowing when to be flexible.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,970
By default, text is fluid.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,140
So, depending on our approach,

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,080
responsive typography can be easily achieved,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,700
and there are many CSS features and tools

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,350
that can help us maintain a consistent baseline,

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,320
make a font size flexible, 

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,840
or respond to different viewport sizes. 

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,480
So let's get started and learn how

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,280
we can make our text look great in any context. 

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,890
These days, there seems to be countless combinations

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,790
of devices, operating systems, 

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,900
and screen sizes and resolutions

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,000
that can render text differently.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,140
Some differences are more subtle than others. 

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,410
Although text is naturally fluid, 

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,370
it's not exactly a one-size-fits-all solution. 

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,420
For example, a heading may look great

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,959
and proportionately sized

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,210
on a desktop browser, 

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,570
but look entirely different on a tablet

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,090
or mobile device. 

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,150
The same can happen with body text,

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,810
as font sizes, line length, and line height

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,800
may start losing their rhythm

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,940
 and balance proportions

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,760
which can ultimately lead

34
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,510
to illegible and unreadable text. 

35
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,590
We need to consider how our text will look

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,880
in most contexts. 

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,870
Are the word shapes still enticing to the reader?

38
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,730
Is the typographic color still present?

39
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,280
Well the good news is

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,690
that responsive or adaptive typography

41
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,670
isn't all that difficult to achieve. 

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,170
We just need to take some time

43
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,510
to think through how our text should respond

44
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,300
to changes in screen size 

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
and then implement those changes. 

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,450
So let's go over a simple example

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,850
we can apply to just about any project. 

48
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,960
Here we have a simple, one-column

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,200
text layout 

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,740
with a Main Title heading

51
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,570
and a few subheadings.

52
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,020
So far, the layout looks pretty good,

53
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,370
but there is much more we can do

54
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,100
to enhance the text 

55
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,200
by improving readability

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,240
and the vertical spacing. 

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,070
Currently, our line lengths

58
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,180
are fixed, and the font sizes are set

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,210
in pixels. 

60
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,130
So first, let's set our font sizes

61
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,890
 to relative em units so that they scale relative

62
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,210
to the base font size. 

63
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,050
I want to change the body text

64
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,210
to a bigger font size,

65
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,910
because the current font size of 16 pixels

66
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,990
seems a little small. 

67
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,000
So let's go ahead and make it 18 pixels. 

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,770
We'll use the target divided by context

69
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,880
equals result formula

70
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,210
to convert our body font size

71
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,510
to ems. 

72
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,900
[typing]

73
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,250
So 18 divided by 16

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,990
gives us a body font size

75
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,950
 of 1.125em. 

76
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,850
[typing]

77
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,540
This establishes a new context

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,310
for our font sizes and line height. 

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,710
What we did was make the new font size

80
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,890
1.125 times larger

81
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,020
than the browser's default size 

82
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,100
of 16 pixels. 

83
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,870
Sizing body text shouldn't be entirely based

84
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,000
on personal preference. 

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,660
We need to consider things like reading distances

86
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,370
and the screens or devices it may be viewed in. 

87
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,710
Desktop screens are generally further away

88
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,990
than tablets or most mobile devices,

89
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,490
and it's a larger screen,

90
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,540
so the font size should be slightly bigger. 

91
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,300
Eighteen pixels seems to be a good size

92
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,450
for this typeface we chose--

93
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,110
PT Serif--

94
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,150
so we'll keep that size for our main body text. 

95
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,390
But we can also make our headings

96
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,820
a little larger, too. 

97
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,390
When sizing type, 

98
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,220
it's not good practice to

99
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,150
just select a random font size

100
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,240
that we think would look good. 

101
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,540
We probably could get away with it here,

102
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,579
since it's a simple page with 3 heading sizes

103
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,610
and body text,

104
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,380
but it's good to use a typographic scale,

105
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,570
because it helps us achieve

106
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,650
a consistent hierarchy,

107
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,510
and it ensures that our design

108
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,870
stays harmonious in every way.

109
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,650
Here is an example of the traditional

110
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,520
typographic scale,

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,370
which increases gradually in increments 

112
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,580
of 1, 2, 3,

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,170
and, finally, 12,

114
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,490
to ensure consistency in the proportions. 

115
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,340
We'll go ahead and base our font sizes

116
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,560
on this scale, which they already are, 

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,980
we just need to convert our headings

118
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,060
from pixels to em units. 

119
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,690
Using our new font-size context

120
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,390
of 18px,

121
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,590
we'll change our heading size here

122
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,620
from 72px

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,410
to 4em.

124
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,120
For our Heading 2, we can change that

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,570
to 2em,

126
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,770
which is twice the 18-pixel font size.

127
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,910
And just below in our Heading 3, 

128
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,240
we'll change it from 24px

129
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,840
 to 1.333.

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,920
And finally, for our Code Example text,

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,710
we can set a font size,

132
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,390
but this time we want to set it

133
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,250
back to 16 pixels. 

134
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,720
So instead of just typing "16 pixels," 

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,410
we can use the "rem" unit,

136
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,910
which stands for "root em"

137
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,620
which just resizes it back

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,980
 to the base root unit 

139
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,200
of 16px. 

140
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,610
When we refresh the page, 

141
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,710
there we see our new font sizes

142
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,550
set in ems. 

143
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,380
Optimal readability requires a certain amount of control

144
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,520
over the line length.

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,800
So next, we'll need to create a fluid line length

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,860
that resizes whenever the browser width

147
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,300
is reduced

148
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,170
or when the page is viewed on smaller screen sizes,

149
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,360
like on mobile devices. 

150
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,190
Because, as we can see here, 

151
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,920
the width of our lines

152
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,830
are fixed, because currently 

153
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,860
our containing element

154
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,320
or "wrap div"

155
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,330
is set to a fixed width

156
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,780
of 600px. 

157
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,760
In order to make it fluid, 

158
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,460
we'll need to define the width in percentages.

159
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,700
Fiddling around with percentage numbers,

160
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,710
I came up with a width 

161
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,460
of 58,

162
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,280
which closely matches the 600-pixel width. 

163
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,650
We'll give it a max width of 58%.

164
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,460
That way it cannot grow any more than that. 

165
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,530
So now when we refresh this, 

166
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,860
the lines of text are fluid

167
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,170
and resize to 58%

168
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,550
 of the viewport width. 

169
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,650
But notice when we are at a smaller width, 

170
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,580
the lines of text are now

171
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,330
 too short. 

172
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,040
So we once again need to adjust a few things here. 

173
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,190
At the bottom of our style sheet, 

174
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,770
we have 2 media queries

175
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,110
and that's all we'll need for this particular example. 

176
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,500
If you want to learn more about media queries, 

177
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,110
take a look at the Deep Dive on media queries

178
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,690
or check out Allison Grayce's series

179
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,870
on responsive web design. 

180
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,810
But, here, we'll need to make things adaptive

181
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,720
with as few breakpoints as possible. 

182
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,460
In fact, we'll only adjust it

183
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,300
at 1 breakpoint. 

184
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,930
So whenever the browser is reduced

185
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,630
below 600px, 

186
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,790
the max width of our wrap

187
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,850
will increase to 85%.

188
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,520
We'll refresh that. 

189
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,820
Now you can see how

190
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,860
it adjusts right here. 

191
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,480
So the line of text is no longer too short. 

192
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,690
It's actually quite readable. 

193
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,820
Next let's adjust the font size of the body text

194
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,850
so that it's not too big

195
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,250
if the screen is narrower

196
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,610
 than 600px. 

197
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,250
We'll just need to reset

198
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,600
the body font size to 1em.

199
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,800
One em is equivalent to 16px,

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,230
so this becomes our new context 

201
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,799
for font sizes when the viewport is less

202
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,480
than 600-pixels wide. 

203
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,630
Back in our browser, we can see that

204
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,350
when the page

205
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,040
is reduced below 600px, 

206
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,250
the paragraph text and headings

207
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,690
scale down accordingly and still maintain

208
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,200
their proportions. 

209
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,420
But notice the line lengths are now too long,

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,540
and they keep increasing in length

211
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,140
the wider the browser gets. 

212
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,540
So we'll need one more media query

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,820
to adjust this and make sure the text

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,460
doesn't get any wider 

215
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,810
once the viewport is wider than

216
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,400
980px,

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,560
because that will still preserve our readable line length. 

218
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,550
So in our media query here, 

219
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,570
we'll once again select our wrap div,

220
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,380
and we will give it a max width

221
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,000
of 600px. 

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,190
This will give us that optimal reading length

223
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,130
of about 60 characters. 

224
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,040
[typing]

225
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,650
Now if our browser exceeds

226
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,010
a width of 980px, 

227
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,100
the text will stay fixed

228
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,640
at 600px,

229
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,470
and the line lengths won't increase.
