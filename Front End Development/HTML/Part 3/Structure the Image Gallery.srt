1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,930
Our navigation is finished, but now we
need

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,630
to create a structure for the image
gallery.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,590
We'll do this with a similar technique
that also uses an HTML list.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,455
Similar to our navigation area, we're now
going to use another

5
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:22,260
unordered list to build our gallery inside
of our section element.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,780
So I am going to scroll down here and
delete this temporary paragraph

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,560
that's inside of our section, and instead,
I'm going to type an unordered list.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,705
And inside of that unordered list, I'm
going to type a single list item.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:44,550
We'll create other list items, but it's
easier to fill out this one first.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,390
We'll then copy it and make the necessary
modifications because most

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,180
of these will be the same with just a few
small changes.

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,160
Now we need to pull in some images for our
gallery.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm actually going to pull in all the

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,420
images we'll need for the rest of this
project.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,520
To download them, simply download the
project files associated with this video.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,690
You should find a link to them next to the
video player.

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,140
Once you've downloaded them, you should
have a zip file that looks like this.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,410
Next, unzip the file and then find the
folder inside called Image.

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,810
You can upload the files into Workspaces

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,370
by dragging them onto the Workspaces
sidebar.

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,900
To do this, simply select all of the files
inside the Image

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,880
folder and make sure that you don't select
the actual folder itself.

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,750
Then with just the files selected, drag
them into the Workspaces window

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,850
and drop them in the darkened area that
says, Drop Files to Upload.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,660
This will automatically import all of the
files.

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:11,610
Now we need to create a folder inside of
our workspace called Image.

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:19,380
To do this simply right-click in any blank
area in the sidebar and select New Folder.

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,460
I'll type in img and hit Enter, and then

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,580
we need to drag each of our image files
into the folder.

30
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,470
So I'll drag all of these

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,460
into the folder here.

32
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,241
And the only file that should be outside

33
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:52,700
of the image folder is the index.html
file.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,660
For the gallery images, you should feel
encouraged to use your own pictures.

35
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,790
You can, of course, use these but if you
want to customize

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,790
the site, you could use your own artwork
or your own photographs.

37
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,125
This project works best with images that
are sized to a width of

38
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:16,530
1,024 pixels, and a height of 768 pixels.

39
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,260
Or more commonly, 1,024 by 768.

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,430
We won't go into detail here about how to
resize images,

41
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,330
but most image editing programs like
Photoshop can do this very easily.

42
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:37,060
With our images in place, let's use them
in our layout like this.

43
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,460
I'm going to go to this list item and open
it up.

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:51,400
And inside, I'm going to type a tag called
img with an attribute called src.

45
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,145
Inside of that attribute I'm going to type
the value

46
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:04,560
img/numbers-01.jpg.

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,330
I'm going to type a second attribute,
called alt and

48
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,170
then I'm going to leave it blank for right
now.

49
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,240
Here, we've introduced the image element,
or img, for short.

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,255
Similar to some other elements we've
learned about, it's

51
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:27,580
self-closing, so, you don't need to create
a closing tag.

52
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,880
The image element has two required
attributes.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,810
The first is the source, or src for short.

54
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,730
This is very similar to the href, or

55
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,170
hyperlink reference, that we learned about
for anchor elements.

56
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,410
It simply tells the browser where this
image file is located.

57
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,800
In our case, it's inside of the Image
folder and then we want to use the

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,400
file numbers-01.jpg.

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,370
This is what's called a relative path.

60
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,300
In other words, we're telling the browser
where

61
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,780
this image is located relative to our
index.html file.

62
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,880
The Image folder and the index.html file
are sitting at the

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,870
same level in our directory structure, or
our file tree.

64
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,460
Then inside of our Image folder, we have
our image.

65
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,570
This is different than an absolute URL.

66
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,656
For example, we can type http://.

67
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:46,830
[SOUND] The domain of our website, which
might be example.com, for example.

68
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,770
And then the path to our image.

69
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,750
However, instead of an absolute URL, we're
just going

70
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,190
to use a relative URL in this particular
case.

71
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,410
That will make it easier to upload our
site to a web server later on.

72
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,260
If that doesn't make sense to you right
now, don't worry.

73
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,650
We'll be using more examples of relative
URLs throughout this project.

74
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,190
The second required attribute is the Alt
attribute, which is short for alternate.

75
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,650
This is intended to provide a brief
description of the

76
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,280
visual for when the image isn't available
for some reason.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,790
This might be because the site visitor is
actually

78
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,790
a search engine spider, which can't
actually see visual images.

79
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,410
It also could be because the site visitor
has images disabled in their browser.

80
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,380
Yet another reason is to assist site

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,930
visitors with visual impairments that use
special software

82
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,140
called a screen reader, which reads text
out loud to help them navigate the web.

83
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,720
In our case, we've left the Alt attribute
blank.

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,690
Because in just a moment, we're going to
add a caption to our image, just below it.

85
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,390
When you add a caption, having the same
text

86
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,190
repeated in the Alt attribute is typically
not necessary.

87
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,810
Let's save and then refresh our preview
quickly, to see what this looks like.

88
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,460
As you can see, we now have an image on
the page and it's very large.

89
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,920
But that's because we haven't applied any
visual styling yet.

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,850
We'll do that later on to help resize the
image.
