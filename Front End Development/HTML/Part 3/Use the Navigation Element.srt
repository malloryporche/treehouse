00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,460
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,020
The

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,490
most basic components of our site
structure are now in place.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,810
Let's start filling in the details with
some navigation, content and more.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,520
On most websites, you can click the site
logo on

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,410
the upper left corner to get back to the
homepage.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,950
Right now we only have one page on our
site.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,140
But soon, we'll have multiple pages that
will need to link together.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,560
When a site visitor goes to another page,

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,890
this will be the link that takes them
home.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,650
I'll type it out first and then, explain
it.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:49,950
So I am going to, wrap our H1 and H2
elements, and an anchor element.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,970
And we're just gonna type a little
attribute here.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,150
And then we'll go ahead, and close it.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,380
Just like that, and then more indent these
two lines here.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,980
Links are created with what are called
anger elements or a tags.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,020
The a in these two tags of course, stands
for anchor.

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,580
The anchor element gets its name because
it can be

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,630
used to anchor a URL to some text on a
page.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,230
In this case, we're actually using the
anchor to go to another page.

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,180
Inside of the opening anchor tag, you'll
notice the HREF attribute.

22
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,220
This is short for hyper link reference.

23
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,730
Inside the quotes, I've stated that I want
the destination to be

24
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:00,350
our index dot html file, which is what
we're looking at right now.

25
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,930
When we have, other files to link, we'll
use other destinations.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,810
Inside our header we're going to create
the navigation in the form of a list.

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,930
Which we'll style later.

28
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,080
The first part is easy.

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,140
We just have to add the nav element, which
is short for navigation.

30
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,600
So, I'm just going to skip down here, and
add in, our nav element.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,310
You can use this element to wrap any

32
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,500
kind of website navigation that you put
together.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,590
It doesn't have any special function
inside the browser.

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,690
And it doesn't add any buttons or other
visual bits, its

35
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,460
simply a semantic statement that says,
here's our navigation on the page.

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,150
Inside of the nav element we're going to

37
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,390
create an unordered link of lists like
this.

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,810
The UL element is short for unordered
list.

39
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:16,380
I say unordered because we could also
create an ordered list with an OL tag.

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,550
Until we add our own styling, this
unordered list will look like

41
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,480
a bulleted list, like you might create in
a word processing program.

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,000
An ordered list would look like a list of

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,930
numbers instead of bullet points like in
our unordered list.

44
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,240
Now, lets add some list items.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm going to open up our UL element here

46
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,550
and then I'm going to type a list item
element.

47
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,520
And I'm going to type the word, "

48
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,180
portfolio".

49
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,640
Then I'm gonna type another list item.

50
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,560
And type" about".

51
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:05,330
And then, one last list item, which will
say Contact.

52
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,460
Now, I've created three list item
elements, using these li tags.

53
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,280
Then inside I've added some text.

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:21,410
Let's save our work, and then switch over
to our preview, and refresh the page.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,240
As you can see, our headline elements at

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,570
the top Are now colored blue with an
underline.

57
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,520
This is the default styling or a hyperlink
that's provided by the browser.

58
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,870
Our navigation looks like a bulleted list.

59
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,570
However, we need to add some links here,
in order for our

60
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,030
site visitors to get around to different
pages that we'll create later.

61
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,930
Let's go ahead and add those links right
now though.

62
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,180
So I'll switch back to my work space, and
in between

63
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,910
my opening list item tag, and the Word

64
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,070
portfolio, I'm going to type a hyperlink.

65
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,400
And I'm going to link this to index.html
because our portfolio

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,960
is actually going to be on our home page
or our index page.

67
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,400
And I need to wrap portfolio,

68
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,960
in a closing anchor, just like that.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,490
Now, with my about page, I'm going to do
the same thing,

70
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,670
except this time, I'm going to choose a
different destination.

71
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,420
In this case, it will be about.

72
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:56,000
Dot html, and I'm just going to cut my,
closing

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,060
anchor tag there and put it around a bell,
finally,

74
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,350
I'm going to type contact.html for this
final destination here.

75
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,510
And I'm going to then close it.

76
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,440
So there we go.

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,050
We have three new links here.

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,350
Again, the first page is our Index page or
our Home page.

79
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,370
And the other two pages are our About page
and our Contact page.

80
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,810
These pages don't exist yet, but we'll
create them

81
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,170
once we're done with the HTML for our
first page.

82
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,200
Let's go ahead and save this.

83
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,570
Switch over to out preview and refresh,
and

84
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,920
as you can see, we now have hyperlinks.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,200
For each one of our pages.

86
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,400
If you click on the links now, they'll
probably give you some type of error.

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,420
When a link doesn't work because the page

88
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,270
or content doesn't exist, it's called a
broken link.

89
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,590
And we certainly don't wanna launch our
site with any broken links.

90
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,580
We'll fix those later.
