1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,140
Now, there's a few more things we should
do for our nav links.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,320
Specifically, we should make it obvious
which page the visitor

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,540
is currently on, by selecting and
highlighting the current nav link.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,820
We'll do this by jumping back into our
mark up.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,300
So we'll go into our html, here.
And we'll add an attribute called a class.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,570
Now, I just mentioned a

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,640
class, but I didn't explain what it is.
So a class is similar to

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,670
an id, but the difference is that you can
have multiples of a same class

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,620
on a page.
All ids however, must be unique and

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,710
cannot be repeated on a single page.
So, let's go ahead and add that

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,280
class and I'm going to add it to
index.html or

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,120
the portfolio link here, because that's
the page that we're currently on.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,920
And I'm going to say class and I'm going
to apply the class selected.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,550
Now, just like ids, this can be anything
you want.

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,830
This isn't a predefined class.
This is just a class I made up.

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,080
So we'll need to apply some styling to
match it in our CSS.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,760
We've could have used an id in

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,130
this particular instance, but adding a
class will

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,130
give us greater flexibility in case
there's a

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,720
strange navigational situation where we
want multiple selections.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,350
In this case, we've applied the selected
class to our homepage link.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,710
This will indicate to the site visitor
which page they're currently on.

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,540
So, let's save that and then jump into

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,270
our CSS, and utilize this class.
So,

25
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm going to create a new rule here, and
say nav

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,618
a, and then apply the class.
And to do that we use dots.

27
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:03,470
I'll say .selected

28
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,340
and then we'll open up the rule here.
So, basically any

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,430
anchor element that's inside of our nav.
That

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,660
has the class selected applied to it.
We'll get

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,710
these style declarations.
So, we're just going

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,020
to apply a color here, and I'm going to
type out a new color.

33
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:34,100
And the value will be 32 for red, 67 for
the green and

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,300
3F for the blue.
So RGB.

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,440
Now, you've seen a few hexadecimal colors
so far, so without hovering over

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,030
this, I want you to try and guess what
this color might be.

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,330
Have you guessed it?

38
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,170
I'm going to hover over.
And guessed dark green, that's correct.

39
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,890
It's very similar to our other colors that
we've been applying previously.

40
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,240
So once again, just to review, if there's
an anchor element

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,530
with the class selected applied, it will
get this dark green color.

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,070
Want to also apply this dark green color
to

43
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,220
the hover state, which is another
pseudoclass similar to visited.

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,070
So, let's go ahead and break apart this
selector into two selectors.

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,060
And say nav anchor and then

46
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,770
apply the pseudoclass, hover.
So any time we hover

47
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,890
over this link with our cursor, it will
change to this particular color.

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,760
What does that mean?

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,090
Well, let's save this and go back to our

50
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,550
preview and refresh, and see what it looks
like.

51
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,230
As you can see the portfolio text is

52
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,680
a darker color now and that's because the
selected

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,920
class has been applied.
And, if I hover my cursor over the other

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,930
links here, you'll see that the hover
state activates and changes the color.

55
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,400
Pretty cool.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
The last thing I want to style is the

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,040
background color and text color of our
body element.

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,020
Which basically encapsulates the entire
website.

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,350
We'll set the background to white and

60
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,836
the text color to grey.
That will make the text feel a

61
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:26,475
little less harsh because it will have
slightly lower contrast.

62
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:31,623
So, let's switch back to our CSS and I'll

63
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:36,771
scroll down here, I'm gonna type body and

64
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:42,385
then I'm gonna say, background color.
And I set

65
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:46,385
it to white, of course this is white by
default, but we want

66
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:51,590
to make sure that no other styling
overrides that for some strange reason.

67
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,514
We want to make absolutely sure that our
background

68
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,807
color is the color that we want it to be.

69
00:04:56,807 --> 00:05:02,040
And then I'm gonna set the text color
using the color property And I'm going to

70
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,400
apply another shorthand hexidecimal value.
Now once again I want

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,990
you to try and guess what this color is
going to be.

72
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,170
And it's going to be this grey color.

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,140
So let's go ahead and save that, switch
over to our preview and refresh.

74
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,570
And if we scroll down the page here to
where we have some text, you can see that

75
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:32,410
it is now this light grey color.
Those are most of the colors that we'll

76
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,010
use on our website.

77
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,150
Later on, we'll add color in a few more
places.

78
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,460
Before we continue, let's review what
we've learned.
