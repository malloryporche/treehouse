1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,230
Now let's continue.
I'm going to set the font weight to

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:12,000
normal.
so font weight is going to be normal.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,330
So this will basically unbold our headline

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,000
because headline elements are bold by
default.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,624
And then I'm going to set the line-height
to 0.8 ems.

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,262
Now the line-height

7
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:31,880
property determines the amount of space
between each line of text.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,440
This is more important in paragraph text,

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,980
and actually it's more apparent in
paragraph text.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,820
But we want to adjust the spacing here as
well.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,460
Again we're using relative ems as the unit
here.

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,840
Now let's style or second level headline,

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,220
and I'm going to type out the code and
then explain it after I'm done typing.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,370
So font size is going to be 0.75 ems.

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,360
The margin is going to be negative 5
pixels,

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,060
0 and then 0; so we're using 3 values
there.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,600
And then the font weight is going to be
normal.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,180
So what is all this mean?

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,520
Well the font size and font weight should
be

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,220
familiar to you The font weight being set
to normal

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,230
will basically unbold our text like we
just did previously,

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,810
and I'll see what that looks like in a
moment.

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,850
And then the font size is set to 0.75 ms,
so that will

24
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,410
make the font size actually pretty small,
because remember, this is a multiplier.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,310
But the new thing I've done here is

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,050
set a negative margin, and I've also set
three

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,990
values for the margin instead of two like
we've been using previously.

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,340
The first value here, sets the top.
The second

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,880
value, sets the left and right.
And the third value sets the bottom.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,790
In other words, this element only has
margins applied to

31
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,810
the top.

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,920
This negative value that we're applying to
the top will actually pull the

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,960
element closer to the other elements
around it, rather than pushing it away.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,500
This is a common technique when you want
elements

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,550
to be tighter together, especially when
you're styling typography.

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,710
We're going to do more styling throughout,
but

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,350
let's finish up some more font related
stuff.

38
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,290
So

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm going to save that out, and up here.

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,050
I'm going to select the body element once
again.

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,430
So let's come up to the top here, and
select our body again.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,290
And we've already selected our body down
in our colors,

43
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,190
but I want this to be separate from our
colors.

44
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,720
And easy to read.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,260
So, we're going to create a second body
selector here.

46
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,050
And we're gonna apply the other font we
picked out, which is open Sans.

47
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,400
And we're going to fall back to Sans

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,270
Serif, if for some reason Open Sans isn't
available.

49
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,810
This will set everything

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,980
on the site to use Open Sans because we're
applying it to the body.

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,380
With the exception of our first-level
headline,

52
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,280
which has another font applied to it and

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,570
is more specific than the body, so it will
be over-ridden for that one element.

54
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,480
This is a good example of how cascading in
CSS works.

55
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,340
To wrap this up, we're going to style the
navigation section and the footer.

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,840
We're not going to use any new properties
or techniques.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,100
Instead, I want you to try and follow
along, and understand what we're doing.

58
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,440
So, let's go ahead and create a

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,940
new section here by copying our multi-line
comment.

60
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,230
And let's scroll down here.

61
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,473
And I'm gonna put a new multi-line comment
just after our

62
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,870
h2 there.
And I'm going to call those, navigation.

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,490
And then I'm going to select our nav
element here.

64
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,880
And we already have a selector for this,
but again, not selecting colors.

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,370
And I wanna keep that separate in this
particular project.

66
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,120
But you could put them together if you'd
like.

67
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,890
I'm going to align the text center in our
nav.

68
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,150
I'm going to set some padding on the top
and

69
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,180
bottom to ten pixels, and zero on the left
and right.

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,470
And then I'm going to apply

71
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,390
some margin to the top, but I want

72
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,750
everything else to be zero for our
navigation.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,540
Now I'm going to select this multi-line
comment once again, and

74
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,800
just after our navigation here, I'm going
to create a new one for the footer.

75
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,180
And I'm going to select our footer,

76
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,950
and then we're going to create some
decorations

77
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,150
inside of our rule here.

78
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,874
So we're going to set the font size to
0.75 ms.

79
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,490
So the font in our footer will be
relatively small.

80
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,500
We're gonna set the text alignment to be
center, once again.

81
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,550
We're going to set the padding on the top
to

82
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,990
50 pixels, so we are actually using a new
property here.

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,140
Padding, top.

84
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,150
Which is just another way of

85
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,970
specifying that we only want padding on
the top, and then finally,

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,280
we're going to set the color to this very
light grey color here.

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,590
So, let's go ahead and save this and
refresh the page to see how this looks.

88
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,980
If I resize the browser window here, it
will

89
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,630
cut off our images and we'll fix that
later on.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,410
But you can start to see our mobile
website coming together.

91
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,710
We have our footer here.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,820
Ad we have the header up at the top.
There still some spacing issues here, and

93
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,230
a lot of alignment issues, and like I said
the images are still entirely too large.

94
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,260
There's a few problems here, but we're
going to fix all of those things.

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,910
The more you practice with fonts and

96
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,550
typography properties in CSS, the better
you'll get.

97
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,360
It's important that you play with these as

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,270
much as you can, because good typography
skills

99
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,380
will help you a lot when building any web
page.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,440
After a quick assessment, we'll style our
portfolio.
