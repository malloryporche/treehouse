00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,558
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:07,808
We've learned about several different
types of values and

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,570
units in CSS but we haven't really
discussed color yet.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,900
So far we've just used color keywords like
red or blue.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,350
But I have a feeling you're more creative
than that.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,065
And you wanna live in a world of digital
color.

7
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:25,900
[SOUND] There are a few different ways we
can define colors using CSS.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,540
But we're going to learn about hexadecimal
colors in this project.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,430
That looks and sounds complicated at
first.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,290
So let's walk through it slowly.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,790
Hexadecimal is a base 16 numbering system
rather than

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,950
the base ten number system that you are
used to.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,810
After we count from zero to nine, we run
out

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,540
of our traditional numeric values and move
on to the letters.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,740
A, B, C, D, E and F would represent the
numbers ten through 15

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,040
as a single digit or character.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,600
So if we start counting as zero, that's 16
possibilities

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,880
for each place Now, in our normal base ten
numbering

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,980
system, we can combine two of the
numerals, zero through

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,420
nine, for a total of ten possible values
in each place.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,960
If we multiply the number of possible
values in each place together,

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,210
we get a total of 100 possible numbers,
which represents zero through 99.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,060
Now if we combine the two hexadecimal
values together in the same way we are

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,770
used to combining the numeral zero through
nine we can create

25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,060
256 values instead of 100.
That's because each number is 16

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,840
digits and 16 multiplied by 16 is 256.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,120
When we write hexadecimal colors there's a
place for red green and blue

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,930
which are the three colors we can combine
to make any color on a digital screen.

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,520
Each of these three colors consists of two
hexadecimal numbers.

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,050
For a total of six places.

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,170
The first two numbers are for red, the
second two

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,220
are for green, and the last two are for
blue.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,170
The higher each of these values are,

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,720
the more of that color will be mixed in.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,230
So for example, a hex value of all zeros
would be pure

36
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,340
black and a hex value of all F's would be
pure white.

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,590
A number in the middle, like all eight's,
would represent a middle gray.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,740
These values start with a hash, or a

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,300
pound sign to denote that they're hex
decimal values.

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,410
We're going to create a green color using
the value 6ab47b.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,150
If we break this down, the first pair of
values is a medium amount of red.

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,220
The second two values are a high amount of
green.

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,050
And the last two values are a medium
amount of blue.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,670
So, with our knowledge of hexadecimal
colors, let's try one out.

45
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,700
I'm going to create some space to work,
here,

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,800
and just skip down our CSS file a little
bit.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,650
And right here, I'm going to select an
anchor element.

48
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,970
Actually this is going to be all the
anchor elements on our page.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,680
And I'm going to use the color property,

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,350
and I'm going to apply a hexadecimal value
of

51
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,790
6ab47b.

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,120
And if we hover over that hex decimal
value, you can see

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,660
that Work Spaces will automatically show
us what that color looks like.

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,230
Now, I want all of the links on my site to
be green.

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,370
But, throughout this project, you should
pick the colors that you like.

56
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,680
In fact, you'll see me type hexadecimal
colors like this pretty quickly.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,080
It's not

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,220
because I'm magically able to type out
these colors from memory.

59
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,130
It's because I've already picked them out.
When picking colors, you'll need to take

60
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:09,970
some time experimenting, possibly in an
image editing tool like Photoshop.

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,990
I'm going to select our header and add two
new declarations.

62
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,340
Let's go ahead and select our header.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,690
And we'll use the background property and
I'm going

64
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,320
to type in the same color that we used
here.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,770
Actually I can just copy and paste it,
just like that.

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,200
And then I'm going to add a border-color

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,330
which is a property we haven't seen
before.

68
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,270
And I'm gonna add a new color here, which
is 599A68.

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,530
And that should do it.

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,330
Now I'm going to go ahead and save the
page and refresh over here.

71
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,180
And as you can see, Our header is now
green.

72
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,940
However it has the same color as our
links, so they're

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,560
disappearing, and we'll go ahead and fix
that in just a moment.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,340
I'd also like you to notice that there
isn't a border really

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,260
appearing just yet, but we'll use that
border color later on.

76
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,410
Now, let's go ahead and fix the color of
those headlines.

77
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,050
To do that, I'm going to use a new

78
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,560
selector here, and I'll explain this in
just a minute.

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,230
So h1 followed by a coma, and h2, and
we're going to

80
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,730
set the color to white.
Now,

81
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,580
let's take a look at this syntax, because
I've done two new things here.

82
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,392
First, I've styled both our h1 and our h2

83
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:51,770
elements in the same style rule.
The

84
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,930
comma between two elements will break them
into two

85
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,360
separate selectors here.
So, this is actually separating

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,590
selectors and I could have say, a
descendant selector here.

87
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,850
So I can just select an anchor element if
it appeared inside the h1 just like that.

88
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,180
And it would separate it from my second
selector here.

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,020
So we're selecting h1 and separately we're
selecting the h2.

90
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,490
But we're applying the same set of style
rules to them.

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,520
Second, I've used some hexadecimal
shorthand here.

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,110
And I've only used three digits instead of
the normal six.

93
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,740
In this case, each digit will be used as
both digits for each color.

94
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,140
In other words, this is equivalent to
filling out all six

95
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,860
numbers with these values.

96
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,060
Of course these are the highest values
possible and have applied

97
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,910
it to all colors so that will give us a
white color.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Using shorthand for the hexadecimals and
the selectors here, is just a way

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,660
to save a little bit of time and increase
the clarity of your code.

100
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,340
Just to make sure you understand, the code
you see here would

101
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,330
be equivalent to the following.
If I were to type out an

102
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,210
h1.
And set it to the color

103
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,440
white, just like that, with our normal six
hexadecimal digits.

104
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,020
And then if I copied that and pasted it
and set that to an h2,

105
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,230
all of this code here is exactly
equivalent

106
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,394
to this code right here.
It's doing the exact same thing.

107
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:47,090
So this is much shorter than typing out
everything in longhand.

108
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,640
Now, let's go ahead and save this out,
switch over to the browser.

109
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,940
And refresh here and as you can see, we
now have our headlines visible.

110
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,200
However, our navigation is still here.

111
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,720
And it's not visible.

112
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,830
So if I highlight the page here, you can
just

113
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,120
barely make out this navigation links
which you can't see.

114
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,160
So, I want our navigation to have a
slightly darker green background

115
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,610
on mobile devices similar to the border
color that we'll use later on.

116
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:28,610
So let's go ahead and grab that border
color, just like that.

117
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,500
And then we

118
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,230
need to select our navigation, which we
haven't done yet.

119
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,880
So let's make a new selector.

120
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:40,530
And we'll say background and then paste in
that

121
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,170
color we just copied and end it with a
semicolon.

122
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,340
So let's go ahead and save that, switch
back to our preview and refresh.

123
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,650
And as you can see we have a slightly
darker

124
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,640
background applied but our navigation
links still aren't

125
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,250
very visible, there's not very much
contrast there.

126
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,070
So we want to change those to white as
well so that they're extra visible.

127
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,960
So in order to do that let's go ahead and
create another selector here.

128
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,470
That will select the anchor elements
inside of our nav.

129
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,040
And we're going to set the color again to
white, just like that.

130
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,670
So far so good.

131
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,480
However, we want these colors to stay
white no matter what.

132
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,250
Even if the site visitor has already
visited them.

133
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,940
To do that, we're going to create another
selector in this same rule using

134
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,350
a coma and we're going to select the
anchor elements again.

135
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,335
Now what we want to do here is add what's
called a

136
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,100
pseudo class to our second anchor element,
or our second selector here.

137
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,160
It's not a real class in our html but it's
basically a

138
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,100
state that the element can be put into
under the right conditions.

139
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,410
So let's go ahead and add a pseudo class.

140
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm going to type a colon here, and then
I'm

141
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,010
going to type the word, visited.
So this is the visited pseudo class.

142
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,190
I'm going to save that out.

143
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,060
And if we go to our preview, and refresh
the page.

144
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,310
You can see that all of these links are
white.

145
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,920
And even if I click here and go back.

146
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,580
They still remain white, even if they've
been visited.
