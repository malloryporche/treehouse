1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,560
We're almost done with the basics.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,750
Before we move onto styling other pages
and screen sizes, we need to

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,530
build out a navigation and finish up a few
other things on the page.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,280
First, let's fix up our header.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,170
Right now, there is some odd space up at
the top.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,090
That's happening because the first level
headline is pushing it out

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,170
of the way with it's margin, and there's
just not enough space.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,120
So let's go ahead and find our heading
here, and then over the top,

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,730
we'll select our header.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,990
And I'm going to do a few things.
First, I'm going to float it to the left.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:53,140
I'm going to set the margins so that zero
on the top, zero on

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,450
the right, 30 pixels on the bottom, and
zero on the left.

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,430
So there's four values there, for top,
right, bottom, left.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,650
Then we'll set the padding, similarly
we'll use four values; so five pixels and

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:19,820
then zero, zero, zero making sure to put
spaces in between to separate the values.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,960
And again that's five pixels on the top,
and then zero on the right bottom

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,200
and left and if you're having trouble
remembering the syntax when you use four

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,510
values like this.
Just remember that you start at the top

19
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,219
and then you go clockwise.
So you go from top, right, bottom, left.

20
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,990
So let me explain this code in a little
bit more detail.

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,000
Floating it to the left doesn't have any
practical use right

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,230
now but it will later on when we style our
desktop layout.

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,860
So stay tuned for that.

24
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,620
Setting our margins keeps the header
separated

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,910
from other content at least on the bottom.

26
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,590
But removes the problematic margins that
we had on the top, previously.

27
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,390
Then, we add some padding on the top to
separate the

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,660
text without actually removing the margin
from the top of the page.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,230
Now, there's one

30
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,150
more thing we need to do to make this
work.

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,374
We need to set a width of 100%.

32
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:36,150
It's now a floated element which means it
doesn't have an explicit width anymore.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,440
We want to specifically say that this
element should stretch across the entire

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,300
page so we've set a width of 100%.
Now, let refresh the page, and

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,140
see our work.
It looks good.

36
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,420
Now lets dig into this navigation.

37
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,640
Right now our navigation is an unordered
list.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,970
So we're actually going to use a similar
technique that

39
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,500
we used on our gallery, which is also an
unordered list.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,670
First, I'm going to select the unordered
list element and

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,510
set some margins on the left and right,
remove any padding,

42
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,140
and then remove any bullet points.

43
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,570
So let's scroll down, to our navigation
here,

44
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,255
and inside of our navigation element we
have our

45
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,810
un-ordered list and that's what we'll want
to style.

46
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,190
We'll want set list style to none even
though

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,590
there were no bullet points that we could
see.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,940
We still wanna make sure that we are
removing those anyway.

49
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,830
Just in case.

50
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,700
Then we are going to set the margin to
zero and ten pixels,

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,370
so that zero on the top and bottom and ten
pixels on

52
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,950
the left and right, and then we'll set the
padding to zero.

53
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,940
Now, I'm going to use a new property

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,320
I haven't shown you before, and it's
called display.

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,010
Every element has a display property by
default,

56
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,680
and it's set to either block or inline.

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,470
Block level element will take up space in
the page,

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,230
and appear to push other things out of the
way.

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,649
These are things like sections, divs, and
many other elements.

60
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,070
Inline elements are mostly just text.

61
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,200
For example, when we add an anchor element
inside of a paragraph, it

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,980
doesn't push all of the words out of the
way or push anything to the next line,

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,280
it just appears in the same line, or
inline,

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
As the rest of the text, hence the term
inline.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,290
We're actually going to use another
property, though, called inline block.

66
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,570
This will allow us to have these items
side by side, just like inline

67
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,190
elements, but they'll retain other block
level features, such as having

68
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:13,997
a width and height.
So, lets say nav, list items,

69
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:20,590
display in line, block.

70
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,620
Now lets save and refresh the page to see
how that looks.

71
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,370
Awesome, now all of our links Are in a
nice, neat row, just like that.

72
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,290
So in other words, they're in line with
one another but they

73
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,280
still have some block level properties not
just having a width and height.
