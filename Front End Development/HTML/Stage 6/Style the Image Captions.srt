1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,150
Now, let's move on.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,870
The last thing we need to style are the
paragraphs inside of our list.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,310
We've already done a little bit here, but
there's still more that we can do.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,170
So, I'm going to select our gallery.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,810
Select the list items.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,990
Select the anchor elements inside of those
list items.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,210
And select the paragraphs inside of the
anchor elements.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,400
So, just to review our HTML.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,690
We're going from our gallery into the list
items, into the anchor elements.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,480
And then selecting these paragraphs right
here.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,830
So that's where the styling will be
applied.

12
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,650
Let's give them a margin of zero, because
paragraphs do have

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,580
some margin by default, so we want to zero
that out.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,950
We'll set the padding to 5%, just to space
them out a little bit.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,610
We want to decrease the font size because
they're a little bit large.

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,710
So we'll set it to 0.75 ems.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,250
And then, finally, we're going to adjust
the color.

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,450
And we'll set it to bdc3c7.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,664
So, if we save that out, switch back to
browser.

20
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,990
And refresh.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,925
You can see that now we have this lighter

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,660
gray color here applied to our links as
well.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,990
So, whether the text is linked or unlinked
this is the color that will be displayed.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,160
We've set the margin to zero in favor

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,870
of adding padding around the image.

26
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,360
This is better because margin has a
tendency to

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,890
push elements even if they're side of the
parent container.

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,880
In other words, they push elements where
they shouldn't.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,940
And finally, you can see the effect that
the font size declaration had.

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,310
It decreased the size of the fonts here,
so they're a little bit more readable.

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,470
Go ahead and resize, and see what that
looks like.

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,640
Once again there's still more work to do
on

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,900
the desktop layout, but we will get to
that later.

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,110
For now we're just concerned with kind of
the mobile view here.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,660
So far so good.

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,890
There's one last thing we need to fix

37
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,140
before we move our attention on to other
things.

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,270
If you look at the footer you'll notice
that it's somehow up

39
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,630
inside of the gallery here.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,770
That's because it's behaving exactly as
it's been told.

41
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,710
It's simply flowing around these other
floated elements.

42
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,900
We need this footer to be cleared of any
influence from

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,320
the other floats on both the left and the
right sides.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,940
So, let's find our footer and add a
property called clear.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,720
We'll set the value of clear to both
because

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,310
we want it to be cleared on both the left
and the right sides.

47
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,820
So lets scroll up here.
And just below where

48
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,400
it says, text align center, we'll go ahead
and say, clear both,

49
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,410
save that out, switch back to the browser
and refresh.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,520
And as you can see, the footer is now
exactly where it belongs again.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,710
There's still those spacing problems up at
the top of the page, but we'll fix

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,700
that up soon when we put the finishing
touches on our navigation and header.

53
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,060
Our gallery is pretty much done, we'll
need to do some additional work to make

54
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,160
it look better on desktop browsers and
we'll also need to do some mobile testing,

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
but so far things are coming together.

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,870
We're going to build out our navigation in
just

57
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,070
a moment, but first, let's take a quick
code challenge.
