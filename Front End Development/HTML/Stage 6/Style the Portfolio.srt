1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,830
We've coded up our HTML, reset the CSS,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,000
added foundational styles, some colors,
and some typography.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,160
I mentioned this earlier.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,490
But so far we've only been building the
styles for the mobile version of our site.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,000
Now we're ready to start getting into more
intermediate techniques.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,910
Let's get started by building out our
image gallery.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,000
First, I want to review our HTML.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,340
We built our gallery

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,420
as an unordered list.
Here, we have the unordered list

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,270
container with list items inside of it.
Each list

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,340
item is composed of a link and inside of
that link is

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,210
a image and its caption, there are
multiple

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,490
unordered lists on our page so let's add
an id to this list so

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,730
we can identify this list in particular.
I'll call it gallery.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,440
Great.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,630
Now, let's jump into our CSS after saving
this file,

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,810
and let's start building out the styles
for our gallery.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,030
This particular gallery is going to take
up two columns on our mobile site.

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,760
Later on, we'll expand it to three columns
on the desktop layout.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,720
But most of the styling we'll need will
already be complete by that point.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,070
We'll select the gallery element in a
moment.

22
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,820
But first we need to add some special
styling to our images on our site.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,450
I'm going to tear off this tab in Google
Chrome,

24
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,630
and expand it so that we can re-size this
browser window.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,660
Now, presently, this is what our site
looks like

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,050
when we re-size it so that it's closer to

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,700
a mobile size.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,760
You'll see that we have some positioning
issues,

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,880
but most importantly, our images are
entirely too large.

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,200
So, that's what we need to fix right now.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm going to leave the browser window like
this, because that's the way that

32
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,880
we should be looking at it, if we're
building out the mobile version first.

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,350
In order to fix our images, we're going to
give them a max

34
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,090
width of 100% in the general section of
our CSS.

35
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,590
So just like this.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,890
I'll go right below the anchor element
styles, and I'll type image,

37
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,530
and say, max width 100%.

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,240
This won't generate any immediately
obvious changes, but it will become

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,560
important once we start resizing the list
items, which contain our images.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,090
Basically, this max width of 100% tells
the

41
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,120
images to fill the width of their parent
container.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,810
If the container shrinks down in size,
then the image will shrink down with it.

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,140
Without this piece of styling, the images
would break outside

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,880
their containers, and we'd get some very
strange looking pages.

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's style the gallery, so you can see
how this helps.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm going to create a new section of our
CSS called Page Portfolio.

47
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,220
That way we'll know

48
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,340
that this styling is specific to this page

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,560
and doesn't really get used on other
pages.

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,660
So, I'm going to copy our heading here and
I'm

51
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,960
going to scroll down and paste it just
below the footer.

52
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,280
And like I said previously, I'm going to
call this page

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,810
portfolio.
There we go.

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,340
And now, we'll select the gallery element
and apply some styling.

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,460
So we'll use the id selector, as we've
done previously.

56
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,000
We'll set the margin to zero.
Set the padding to zero.

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,370
And set the list style to none.
The new property here

58
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,470
is list style.

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,300
This will remove any kind of bullet points
from a list if we set it to none.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,100
In this case, we're using an unordered
list to layout our gallery.

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,420
So, we don't want the bullet points.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,850
Now, let's style the list items.

63
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,310
We want them to be in two columns somehow
and

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,500
there's many ways that we could do that in
CSS.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,430
One technique

66
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,380
is to use a property called float, which

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,800
will make the elements appear side by
side.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,470
I want you to follow along while I type
this.

69
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,140
Afterwards, I'll explain the code.

70
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,380
So, I'm going to select gallery and then
select the list items

71
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,454
inside of the gallery.
And we're going to say float left.

72
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:04,587
We'll give it a

73
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:10,371
width of 45%, a margin of

74
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:16,637
2.5%, a background color

75
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:22,903
of f5f5f5, and finally, a

76
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:29,550
color of bdc3c7.
There's a couple of things going on here.

77
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,310
First,

78
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,710
I'm going to save this and then refresh
the page

79
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,730
so that you can see what this code just
did.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,090
As you can see, our gallery is starting to
take shape as a two column layout.

81
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,590
.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,490
And, if we expand this out, it starts to
even look better at

83
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,670
desktop sizes but, there's still more
improvements

84
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,330
that we can do there, later on.

85
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,590
First, the big new idea here is the float

86
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,720
property, which is a property that allows
us to position

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,510
elements in a special way.

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,250
The idea comes from print design, where an
image is floated on the page,

89
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,350
to the left or the right, and the text
then flows around that image.

90
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,570
On the web, the float property has evolved
to become extremely versatile.

91
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,860
Floating these elements will make them
appear side by side, rather than stacking

92
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,570
on top of each other, like we saw
previously.

93
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,300
Second, I've set their width to 45%.

94
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,020
That means, regardless of the size of the

95
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,570
browser window, whether it's on a desktop
or a

96
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,515
mobile phone, each image will only ever
take up

97
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:54,510
45% of the total width of it's parent
element.

98
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,460
So, you can see here

99
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,870
how the images are scaling and, no matter
what size the browser window is,

100
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,910
those images take up 45% of the width.
Since

101
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,150
every parent element above the list items
are not set, they default to 100%.

102
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,270
That means that the width of our images
will

103
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,220
be 45% of the total width of the page.

104
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,790
45 divides

105
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,360
into 100 twice with a remainder of 10.

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,695
That means we'll have two images floated
side by side with

107
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:36,710
10% extra room that we can use to create
space between our images.

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,140
To create that space and round it up to
100%,

109
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,850
I've used the margin property and set it
to 2.5%.

110
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,080
So, if we go back to the browser window,
you can see that

111
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,050
each image has a margin on each side of
2.5%.

112
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,780
So, in other words, each image has a 5%

113
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,863
margin in total.
There's 2.5 here, 2.5

114
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:13,283
there.
And then the second image has 2.5 here and

115
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:18,392
2.5 there.
So if you take 2.5 and

116
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:25,550
multiply it by 1, 2, 3, 4 times.
That gives you a total of 10%.

117
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:31,430
That will fill the extra 10% of space that
we had to play with previously.

118
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,550
Finally, I've set the background color to
what will look like a medium gray color.

119
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,590
Let's flip back to our website.
If you look at our website, you'll

120
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,680
see that this background color comes
across for each one of the captions.

121
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,710
Finally, I've set the color of our text to
this gray color here.

122
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,370
You won't see that come across really,
unless

123
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,570
any of the captions are unlinked for some
reason.

124
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,860
Rather, what's being displayed

125
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,350
here is the color of linked text.
Which in this case is this green color.
