1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,580
Now, let's style our anchor elements.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,270
We don't have to be overly specific with
this selector, because there

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,930
are only one set of anchor elements inside
of our nav element.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,710
So, we'll scroll down here, and we'll say
nav a.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,760
And we'll set the font weight to 800.
[SOUND] And we'll

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,570
set the padding to 15 pixels and 10
pixels.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,840
Remember the font weight property can be
set to either normal or bold.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,400
But it can also be set to a specific
number.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,680
When we included our fonts from Google
previously, this was one of the font

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,340
weights that we picked out and I think
this is an appropriate place to

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,270
use it.
Next, we've added some padding on all

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,520
sides of our links.
This will make the click targets

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,650
on them easier to hit with a mouse of a
touch screen device.

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:14,810
So, if we switch back, and refresh, you
can see that our links are now much

15
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,750
bolder and they have more space around
them.

16
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,060
And, when I hover over, you can see that a

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,020
lot of the space around the text is now
also clickable.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,040
Which makes it just, a little bit easier,
to hit these tap targets, when you're

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
on a mobile device, or click on them, if
you're on a desktop like I am.

20
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,060
Before we wrap this section up,

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,840
there's one more loose end that we should
tie up.

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,970
Down in our footer, you'll notice that our
social media icons are pretty large.

23
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,170
We want them to be smaller and less
prominent.

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,680
These icons are about twice the size that
they need to be.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,700
That's because we want these images to
look sharp

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,720
on high resolution displays that have
double pixel density.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,310
By creating the images at twice the size
and then resizing them downward

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,060
using CSS, the pixels will still be there
for high res displays.

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,950
These types of high res displays aren't
everywhere yet, but they're starting

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,560
to become more common in mobile devices,
as well as desktop devices.

31
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,360
In order to do this, we actually need to
switch back to our HTML,

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,660
so that we can properly select, each one
of these.

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,970
On our first link, just after the alt
attribute, I'm going to add a class

34
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,550
attribute, called social-icon.

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,404
Then I'm going to copy that class
attribute and paste

36
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:58,650
it on our second link as well.

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,460
Now we could have selected these in a
slightly

38
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,360
different way, for example we could say
footer And

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,950
then, anchor, but I wanted to show you how

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,300
classes can be used multiple times on a
page.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,880
So in this case, we're going to create a

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,110
CSS class, and it will be applied, to both
items.

43
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,790
So let's save our HTML, and go back to our
CSS.

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,230
And in our footer here, let's skip down
and make

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,430
some room to work.
And I'm going to select our social icons.

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,630
And I'm going to give them explicit width
of 20 pixels, an explicit height

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,480
of 20 pixels, and a margin of zero and
five pixels.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,020
So, that's zero on top and bottom, and
five on the

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,330
left and right, which will give some
separation between the two icons.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
The width and height is half the size of
the icons.

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,640
They're about 40 pixels each.
So, resizing them downward will add more

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,900
detail into a denser area.
Let's go back, refresh the page.

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,009
And as you can see, our icons are now much
smaller and at a more reasonable size.

54
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,450
Great work.
We've made a lot of progress on our site.

55
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,130
At this point, you've learned most of the
skills you

56
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,700
need to build almost any type of simple
web page.

57
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,920
Learning HTML and CSS can be very
challenging at first, but, with continued

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,110
practice you'll find that the elements and
properties become second nature to you.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,230
We still need to create the other pages,
but that will be

60
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,150
much easier now that we have most of the
styling done for

61
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,030
common elements, like the header and
footer.

62
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,370
Before we continue, let's review what
we've learned.
