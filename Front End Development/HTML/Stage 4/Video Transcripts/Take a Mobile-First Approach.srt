1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,930
From this point forward, we're actually
going to

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,320
be building the mobile version of our site
first.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,450
This might seem a little bit
counter-intuitive, but modern websites

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,590
are built with mobile devices in mind from
the start.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,625
There's two factors feeding into this.

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,460
[SOUND].

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,670
First, it's much easier to build a mobile
website

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,920
when you're fist starting out because,
it's much simpler.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,760
You don't have to worry about tons of
complex features,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,080
advertisements, complex layouts, and so
on.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,670
Instead, you have to reduce a website to
its pure essence.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,590
Then, when you move your design up to more
robust

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,190
platforms like tablets and desktops, you
can progressively enhance your website.

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,410
This is easier than creating a really
complex website on the desktop, and

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,400
then trying to figure out how jam that
experience onto a tiny screen.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Second, it's very important to pay
attention to the

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,040
mobile experience, the mobile web is not a
small platform.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,740
In fact, mobile browsing is on track to
eclipse desktop browsing,

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,200
if it hasn't already done so, by the time
you watch this.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,160
It really is moving fast.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,180
So, it's imperative that we design a great
experience on mobile

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,860
from the start, and work our way up to the
desktop.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,670
For your own reference, here's what my

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,000
finished mobile website is going to look
like.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,990
Now, let's jump back into the code and
remove

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,470
that ugly orange background we were using
for testing purposes.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,680
Now, let's remove the orange background on
our wrapper,

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,300
because we don't actually need that in our
project.

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,410
That was just for the purposes of an
example.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,946
And, let's close

31
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:47,277
out this portion of the lesson by styling
our headline elements.

32
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:50,503
To do that, we'll first need to select
them.

33
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:54,931
I'm going to apply an ID called Logo to
the anchor

34
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,960
element, that wraps them.
So, to do that we need to switch over to

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,190
our HTML, and inside of this anchor
element, that wraps our headlines,

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,250
we need to type ID, and we're going to
call it Logo.

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,214
And we'll save that, and then back in our
CSS

38
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:20,790
here, I created a little bit of space
after our wrapper.

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,840
And I'm going to, again, using ID
selector, using the HASH or pound sign,

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,210
and select the Logo, and then, inside of
the selector, I'm going

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,230
to make a few declarations.

42
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,170
And first I'm using the property,
text-align with the value center.

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,100
We'll go over that in just a moment.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,780
And then I'm setting the margin to 0.
Now lets explain what we just did here.

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,802
I've used the text-align property to align
the text, so just like

46
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:57,680
in a word processing program we can align
our text to the left,

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,640
right, or center.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,240
I want my text to be centered, so I've
typed out the value center.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,970
You've probably noticed by now that some
properties take values that are

50
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,870
numeric and some take words, which are
commonly called keywords.

51
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,080
So for example, center, or none, are known
as keywords.

52
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,876
Some properties like margin can even take
both

53
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:30,656
key words and numeric values, as you see
here.

54
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:34,096
When you're first starting to learn CSS,
this can

55
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,736
be a little bit tricky, but if there are

56
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:39,536
keywords that you can use to fill a value,

57
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:43,687
WorkSpaces can help you with its code
completion features.

58
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:48,286
You'll notice that when I finished typing
text-align, and I'll do that

59
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,360
again just so you can see it here.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,510
It will suggest some of those keywords to
complete it.

61
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,240
If I just use the arrow keys, I can move
up and down the selection here, and I can

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,370
select Center and hit Enter to actually
type that out for me automatically.

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,520
I don't need to do that manually, if I
don't want to.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,430
With practice and a few websites, you'll
start to memorize these.

65
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,900
But, don't feel bad if you need to refer
back to

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,370
these videos or use a search engine to
look them up.

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,960
Next, I've applied a value of 0 to our
margin here.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,350
I don't want this element to have any
spacing around the edges, so if I just

69
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,570
apply a 0, it will apply it to all four
sides of our element.

70
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:44,050
Now, if we go ahead and save this file
here, switch over to our preview, and

71
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,170
refresh, you'll see that first, the orange
background has been removed,

72
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,600
but secondly, our headline elements have
been centered on the page.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,870
We've covered a lot of new CSS properties
and values.

74
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,960
So, let's pause for a code challenge, to
make sure that we didn't miss anything.
