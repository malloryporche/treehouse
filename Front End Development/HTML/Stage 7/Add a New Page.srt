00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,727
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:06,520
Great job making it this far.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,990
We've created our homepage but now we're
ready

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,370
to build the About page and the Contact
page.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,040
The About page is less complex than the
Contact page so,

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,310
let's start with that first and then build
on what we learn.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,000
First we're going to create a new file
called about.html.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,040
Unlike our index file, we can actually
call

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,374
this file, whatever we want.
As long as we maintain the .html

10
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:39,660
file extension.
So if I click on,

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,130
My Work Space here, using the right mouse
button, I can

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,248
select new file and I'll just go ahead and

13
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:55,050
type about.html.
And work spaces

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,090
will open the blank file for me.

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,640
Almost every web server recognizes the
special file name index.html.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,958
And it will use it as the home page, which
is why we want to keep its special naming.

17
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:16,340
With our about.html file created, let's
copy all of the

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,320
HTML from our index page over to the about
page.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,050
Because most of what we need is already
there.

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,175
The easiest way to select all of our text
is to use the keyboard shortcut

21
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:35,210
Cmd+A on a Mac or Ctrl+A on Windows.

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,200
So if I just click in my text editing area
and hit Cmd+A on my Mac.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,480
And then hit Cmd+C to copy all of the
text.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,230
I can then click on about.html and hit
Cmd+V to paste all of

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,800
it.
Now, let's save the file and see what it

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,480
looks like in the browser.
So, if I switch over to my browser here,

27
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,975
I can actually click on About and it will
take me to

28
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:18,700
about.html.
Of course, the page looks exactly the same

29
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,500
as our home page, index.html.
Because, we haven't changed

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,690
anything yet.
So let's start modifying about.html.

31
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,190
I'm going to scroll up to the top of the
file here.

32
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,490
And first, I'm going to change the
selected navigation item over to about.

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,560
So I'll remove the class selected from the
portfolio navigation item.

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,180
And I will add the class selected, to
about.

35
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,290
Next, I'm going to delete everything

36
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,210
inside of our section element here.
And I can just start the selection,

37
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,380
and then hold down Shift+Click to continue
the

38
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,820
selection down to where my cursor is.
And then I can just hit the Delete key.

39
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,800
This will leave us with our header, our
navigation and our footer.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,060
And then, leave us with a blank

41
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,940
section that we can fill out later.
That's because we want our

42
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,250
header and footer to be same on every
page, with the exception

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,600
of the selected item.
So I saved about.html.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,310
And let's switch over to the browser and
go to about.html.

45
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,070
And as you can see, we have our header and
our

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,800
footer and then the content area or the
section is blank.

47
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,970
You'll also notice, that the About
navigation

48
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,010
item is now the selected nav item.

49
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,780
If I go back to Portfolio, The portfolio
is the selected nav item.

50
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,530
So if we click back and forth between the
two pages, the site visitor can see

51
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,520
which page they're currently on, just by
looking at navigation.

52
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,870
Now, let's go back to our HTML.

53
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,360
Once we're done, we'll add a little bit of
CSS to make it all work.

54
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,810
Inside of a section, I'm going to add a
profile picture of myself.

55
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,590
Inside of the img folder here,

56
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,570
I have the file nick.jpg.

57
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,180
And that's a picture of me.
So let's go ahead and add it.

58
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,210
I'm going to say image src, for source and

59
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,801
then the path to our image.
Which is

60
00:04:55,801 --> 00:05:03,060
image/nick.jpg.
For the alternate text,

61
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,160
I'm going to say, Photograph of Nick
Pettit

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,140
and then I'm going to add the class
profile photo.

63
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,480
And then I'll close the tag.

64
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,720
This image should already be included in
your images folder.

65
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,130
But, you should add your own profile
picture.

66
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,740
A square image that is around 200 pixels
in

67
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,580
both width and 200 pixels in height should
work best.

68
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,570
But you can go up and down in those values
and the design should still work okay.

69
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,380
Experiment

70
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,920
and see what works best.
Next after our image, I'm going to add a

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,310
third level headline.
That says: About.

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,730
Finally I'm going to add some paragraph
text about myself.

73
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,440
You should customize your own text so that
it's about you.

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm going to say: Hi, I'm Nick Pettit.

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,860
This is my design portfolio

76
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:24,790
where I share all of my favorite work.
When I'm not

77
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,840
designing things, I enjoy exercising,
playing video games,

78
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:40,650
drinking good coffee, and more.
Of course,

79
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,030
your description can be longer or shorter
and you can put whatever you'd like.

80
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,390
Next I'm going to put another paragraph.
And in this paragraph,

81
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,738
I'm going to say, if you'd like

82
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:03,895
to follow me on Twitter, my user

83
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:09,300
name is @nickrp.
Now, it would be nice

84
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,510
if we could actually click on that user
name and go to my Twitter profile page.

85
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,760
And again, this should of course, be your

86
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Twitter profile or whatever link that
you'd like.

87
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,500
So we've wrapped it in

88
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,510
an anchor element.

89
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,250
And I'm going to copy and paste the link
to my Twitter profile.

90
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,910
Just like that.

91
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,640
So now, if you click in the footer, you
can go to my Twitter profile.

92
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,360
Or you can go ahead and just click this
link in the text.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,420
Now, let's refresh the page, after saving
of course.

94
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,850
And see what it looks like before we add
any CSS.

95
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,820
So there's the picture of me.
There is our About headline.

96
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,190
And then there is the paragraph text that

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,540
we wrote.

98
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,930
And you can see that @nickrp is linked to
my Twitter profile page.

99
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,210
Great.
