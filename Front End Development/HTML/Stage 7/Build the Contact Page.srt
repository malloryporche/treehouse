1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,210
We're done with our portfolio and About
pages.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,720
Now we need to get to the Contact page.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,280
Let's get started.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,650
First, we'll start the same way we did
with our About page.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,350
We'll need to create a new file, called
contact.html.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,790
So I'll just right-click in my directory
structure here.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,930
And I'll say contact.html,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,440
for the file name.
And when I hit Enter, you can see that it

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,780
opens up contact.html.
Now, let's copy our HTML

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,500
from the About page, and paste it in.
To do that, I'm just

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,110
hitting Cmd+A on my Mac, or Ctrl+A if
you're on Windows.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,970
Then I hit Cmd+C to copy, or Ctrl+C if

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,430
you're on Windows.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,120
And then finally, Cmd+V, or Ctrl+C to
paste it in.

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:04,100
Next, we'll need to change the selected
nav item to contact.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,260
So, I'll go ahead and cut, by

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,620
hitting Cmd+x on my Mac or Ctrl+x if
you're on Windows.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,770
And then I'll paste it back in.
Being very careful to preserve the

19
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,990
space, between class and href there.
So

20
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,420
now, if I save out, and switch over to my

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,560
preview, and refresh, I can go to the
Contact page.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,510
And the contact nav item, will be
selected.

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,600
However the Contact page looks exactly the
same as our About page because we haven't

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,850
made any modifications to it yet.
So let's go back to the Contact page.

25
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,390
And, similar to what we did previously,
we're

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,380
going to delete everything inside of our
section here.

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,500
Eventually, this page will be a two column
layout, but

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,020
in our mobile view, it will only be a
single

29
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,960
column with two sections.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,830
So, we need to create a second section
here.

31
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,580
So I'll just copy my section and paste it,
and

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,820
now we have two for each one of our
columns.

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,970
Again, this will be two columns on our
desktop view but our

34
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,980
mobile view will just have them stacked.
Now, the first section is pretty easy.

35
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm just going to add a

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,450
third level headline.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,140
And I'm going to say, General Information,

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,100
and then I'm going to add a paragraph.

39
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,480
This paragraph text will describe the best
way to get in touch with me.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,847
I'll say, I am not currently looking for
new design work, but

41
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:08,810
I am available for speaking gigs and
similar engagements.

42
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,960
If you have any questions, please don't
hesitate to contact me.

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,410
And of course, you want to go ahead

44
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,900
and customize this text to whatever you'd
like.

45
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,450
Let's add another paragraph just to give
it some separation.

46
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:39,514
And in this paragraph I'm going to say,
please only use phone contact for urgent

47
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:46,130
inquiries.
Otherwise, Twitter

48
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:53,090
and email are the best way to reach me.

49
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,830
Now the second section is going to start
off with a H 3 as well.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,010
And inside we'll say Contact Details,

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,390
then I'm going to create an unordered list

52
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,750
that will include a few ways to contact
us.

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,580
On the unordered list, I'll add the class
contact info.

54
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,180
So let's create that unordered list.

55
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,110
And say class, contact-info.
And just

56
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,900
to remind you one more time, this will be
the first column, and this will the second

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,520
column, side by side in our desktop
layout.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,290
But in our mobile layout they'll be
stacked.

59
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,140
So these contact details, in our mobile
layout, will appear just

60
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,550
below this general information, and we'll
see that in a moment.

61
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,980
Now let's fill out this unordered list.
Inside I want three items for

62
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,030
phone, email, and Twitter.
On each item, we'll use different

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,290
types of lengths, based on the method of
contact.

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,680
For phone, I'm going to add the class
phone to the list item.

65
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,820
We'll need these classes later on when
we're

66
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,700
adding icons next to them in our CSS.

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,250
Next I'm going to create a link with

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,310
a fake phone number that's just for the
purposes

69
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,730
of this example, but if you feel
comfortable doing

70
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,060
so, you can add your own phone number
here.

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,120
So I'm going to say, a href we'll fill in
href in just a moment.

72
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,048
Inside of the link, I'm going to

73
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:48,056
say 555-6425.
And inside

74
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:53,273
of the href, I can say tel, for telephone,

75
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:58,349
with the colon, and then I'll put the same

76
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,532
phone number, 555-6425.
And save

77
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,577
that out.

78
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:10,070
As you can see, this is a different type
of link than what we've ever used before.

79
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,930
We've added the special keyword tel for
telephone inside

80
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,840
of the href attribute followed by the
phone number.

81
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,670
On smart phones this will tell the browser
that it's a telephone number it can dial.

82
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,560
So if you bring up this website on your
smart phone browser,

83
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,790
you can actually tap on this link and it
will dial this phone number or

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,730
it will at least present a modal window
asking you if you'd like to dial the phone

85
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,795
number.
Next, let's add the email length.

86
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:50,916
I'm going to create a new list item, with
the class, Mail.

87
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,398
I'm going to create an anchor element,

88
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:56,853
with a blank href attribute we'll fill out
in a moment.

89
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:01,563
And I'm going to put in a fake email
address, nick@example.com.

90
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,010
And inside of the href attribute I'm going
to say

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,024
mail to, with a colon and then

92
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:18,600
Nick@example.com.
Similar to the phone

93
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,960
number, I've used the keyword mail to.
This will tell

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,060
the browser its an email address that the
use can send mail to.

95
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,470
Typically this will open the default email

96
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,850
client on the site visitors computer; such
as,

97
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,940
Outlook Express or Apple mail or whatever
the

98
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,540
default mail program is for that
particular user.

99
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,010
This is just an example email address, so

100
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,630
be sure to add your own email address
here.

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,240
Finally, let's add a Twitter link.

102
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:02,770
I'm going to create a new list item, with
the class Twitter.

103
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,490
And then,

104
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm going to create an HREF attribute

105
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,364
inside of an anchor element, and type
@nickrp.

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,660
Now, I'm going to use a slightly

107
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,840
different Twitter address than we've used
previously.

108
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:31,229
It's going to say
HTTP://twitter.com/intent/tweet

109
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,392
with a question mark.
And then

110
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:42,904
screen_name=nickrp.

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,290
This Twitter link is a bit different than
the ones that we've used before, because

112
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,680
it allows the site visitor to immediately
start writing a tweet

113
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,630
to us, rather than leading to the Twitter
profile page.

114
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:05,090
Just be sure to replace the username with
your own user name instead.

115
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,470
Let's refresh the browser to see what this
looks like.

116
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,810
So here, I'm on the Contact page.
And I've refreshed the browser.

117
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,940
Here are our two third-level headlines.

118
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,710
Here are the two paragraphs that we've
added.

119
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,660
And finally, here's the unordered list
with Contact Details.

120
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,600
We have a telephone number, which if I
click

121
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,300
in a web browser, isn't actually going to
do anything.

122
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,720
But it will bring up a

123
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,148
prompt on Smart Phones, if a user taps
this.

124
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:44,900
And then nick@example.com will actually
bring up

125
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,490
my email, so I can compose a message.

126
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,800
In this case it will bring up gmail,
because that's my default email client.

127
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,140
And then finally, if we click on the
Twitter link we added

128
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,950
here, you'll see that it doesn't bring us
to the Twitter profile

129
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:09,210
page, rather it brings us to a page where
we can immediately, type a tweet.

130
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,790
I'm going to go back because, I don't have
any need to tweet to myself.

131
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,520
This looks good so far.

132
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,950
Now we're ready to add some additional
styling.
