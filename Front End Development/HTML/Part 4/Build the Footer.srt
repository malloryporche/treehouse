1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's wrap up this portion of the project
by building out the footer.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,070
We already have our copyright in place,
but we should add some social links

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,460
and icons so that people can connect with
us from any page on the site.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,330
First, let's add in the social icons for
Twitter and Facebook.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,640
If you don't have a Twitter account or

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,710
a Facebook account or either one don't
worry.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,200
You can go ahead and link to whatever site
you'd like

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,560
or you don't have to link to any site at
all.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,330
If you do choose to link to another

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,140
website or another social network, just be
sure

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,020
to replace the imagery with the
appropriate logo

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,260
for that social network, or for that site.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,810
The iconography we need for Twitter and
Facebook are included with the project

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,040
files for this video.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,030
So if you haven't already downloaded the
images folder,

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,610
like we did in the previous video, be sure

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,610
to do that now and include them in the

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,910
project, simply by dragging them onto the
file tree here.

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,220
Now, let's go ahead and scroll down to our
footer.

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,630
And inside of this footer,

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm going to type image src for source

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,420
and then I'm going to type the relative
path to our Twitter

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,822
wrap ping image here or PNG.
So I'm going to type

24
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:39,396
Twitter-wrap.png

25
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:42,770
and I need to go back to the beginning
here to make sure

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,320
that I include the image folder there
because it's inside of the images folder,

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,620
so just typing Twitter-wrap won't work.
You need the images folder.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,640
And then I'm going to type an alt
attribute.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,630
And in this case, we're not going to add
captions to these images.

30
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,805
So we do need to add an alt attribute.
So the alt attribute I'm going to type,

31
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:12,500
is just going to say, Twitter Logo,
because that's what this picture is.

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,880
Now to save some time, I'm going to copy
this line and paste it

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,520
because we just need to change Twitter to
say Facebook

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,490
and then we just need to change the alt
attribute to also say Facebook.

35
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,610
Again,

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,990
you could find alternative icons that you
like better provided

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,870
you have the permission from the owner to
use them.

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,880
Now, let's link these to our Twitter and
Facebook profiles.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm going to type in the links to my
personal Twitter and Facebook here.

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,660
But you should type in the links to your
own profile.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,910
So, at the beginning of this line, I'm
going to type an anchor

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,225
element with the href.

43
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:11,220
Http://twitter.com/NickRP,

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,740
which is my username on Twitter.

45
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,770
Then I'm going to close this.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,660
And I'm just gonna take this closing
anchor tag,

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,680
and put it at the end of this line.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,510
So we have an opening anchor.

49
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,880
The image for Twitter, and then a closing
anchor.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,090
So this will create a picture that links
to my Twitter profile.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Now, we need to do the same thing for
Facebook.

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,650
So I'm just going to copy that line and
paste it here.

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,056
We need to change

54
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:53,050
twitter.com to facebook.com.

55
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,990
And my username on Facebook is different
than my Twitter handle.

56
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,560
So I'm going to type Nick Pettit and then
at the end of this line, which

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,330
you'll notice has actually wrapped to the
next

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:13,040
line, I'm going to close my anchor
element.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,390
If you don't want

60
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,900
to wrap to the next like this you can go
up to

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,820
the View menu and uncheck Word Wrap and
that will leave your lines

62
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,680
as is, but it will add in a scroll bar
down at the

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,430
bottom so that you can see what's at the
end of the line.

64
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,430
I actually prefer to keep word wrap on so
that I can see all of my code at

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,120
once without having to scroll
horizontally.

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,180
So again, even though this looks like it's
on a new line, it's actually all one line.

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
And you can see that if you look at

68
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,550
the line numbering over here on the left
hand side.

69
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,850
Now let's save the page, go to our
preview, and refresh.

70
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:04,660
If

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,350
I scroll all the way down to the bottom of
the page, you can see the logos for

72
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:19,310
Twitter and Facebook and if I click them,
it will bring up my Twitter profile.

73
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,860
Now there is one more very important thing
that

74
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,850
I'd like to point out before we wrap up.

75
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,320
We've used two different types of links on
this page now.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,240
Notice how the links in the images

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,410
are relative links like we discussed
previously,

78
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,600
but over here, we have the full web
address, which is an absolute link.

79
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,510
A relative link describes the location of
a file relative to the current file.

80
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,870
So again, index is relative to the image
folder.

81
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,850
They're sitting at the same level in the
directory structure.

82
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,180
And you can see that because they're
aligned with one another just like so.

83
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,220
And then inside of the image folder,

84
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,920
is our image, twitter-wrap and
facebook-wrap.

85
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,870
If you can't see all of the filename, you
can go ahead and adjust the size of the

86
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,590
gutter here or the size of the file tree

87
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,120
relative to the size of the text editing
area.

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,940
As a general rule you want to use relative
links whenever possible,

89
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,240
because this will make your website more
portable.

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,000
What I mean by that, is when we take

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,620
our entire directory structure and put it
somewhere else,

92
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,830
all of these relative links will still
work with

93
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,802
this index file, because they're in the
same directory together.

94
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:06,120
If Iwere to type out the full domain name
here,

95
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,850
so we could say, example.com/image/ the
name

96
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,210
of the file, and if we did that, and then
we tried to put this website on

97
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,680
another domain, such as example two or
something like that,

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,380
then all of our images would break because
it's not the same path anymore.

99
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,210
So you want to keep

100
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,920
these relative.

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,400
However, because we're linking to an
external website such as Twitter

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,280
and Facebook in this particular case We do
need to use absolute links.

103
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,080
So to remember this rule just think you
need to use relative links whenever you

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,960
can and only use absolute links when you
absolutely have to.

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
We added a ton more markup to our page.

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,900
It can take a long time to memorize HTML
elements and CSS properties.

107
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,190
And even the best web designers look
things

108
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,970
up using a search engine all the time.

109
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,420
Don't worry if you're having trouble
taking in everything we're covering.

110
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,480
What will help more than anything else is
lots of practice so let's pause for

111
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,440
a code challenge and code some more with
the elements that we just learned about.
