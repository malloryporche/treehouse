1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,720
Now, let's dig into the body element, and
add some real page

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,615
structure.
I'm going to jump

3
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:15,760
into the body, and type a header tag, and

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,905
then I'm going to put our h1 inside of the

5
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:26,004
header.
Just below the header, I'm going

6
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:29,330
to create a section element.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,960
And then below that, I'm going to create a
footer.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,190
One thing you'll notice about WorkSpaces
is, is that if you type enough of

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,140
the element that you're trying to create
it will auto complete it for you.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,350
If I type some of the element here

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,530
and then hit enter it will automatically
complete

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,550
the rest of the element name.
If I then close the tag, it

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,300
will add the closing tag for me.
Again, this is just more

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,850
code completion that allows you to type
faster by typing less.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,470
Now, I've added three new elements here,
the header

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,850
element, the section element and the
footer element.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,170
This provides the basic structure for our
site content,

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,140
let's go through each one of these new
elements.

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,010
The header element is different than the
head element that we added earlier.

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,940
The head element is just for the web
browser to read meta data about the

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,570
HTML document.
This new header element is

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,120
actually a part of the site's content and
helps

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,940
structure the information that we're
displaying to site visitors.

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,970
Inside of it we have the first level
headline that

25
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,770
we created earlier and I've made sure to
continue indenting properly.

26
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,140
Now, before we move on to the section and
footer, let's

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,080
add a second level headline that matches
the title we created earlier.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
The headline will be slightly smaller than
our

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,960
first level headline when it's rendered on
our webpage.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,460
So, after my first level headline, I'm
going to type h2.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:29,560
And then, inside of that, I'm going to
type, designer.

32
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,970
Now, this section element will soon
contain our image gallery.

33
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,350
Sections, just as the name implies, break
up a page

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,590
into logical groupings of information,
just like sections of a newspaper.

35
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,310
We're not ready to build our gallery just
yet but let's add a temporary

36
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,570
placeholder paragraph, so that when we
preview

37
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,170
the page, we'll know where this section
appears.

38
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,890
So, inside of my section,

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,670
I'm going to type a paragraph element

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,120
and I'm going to say, gallery will go
here.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,280
The footer element is a complement to the
header element.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,610
Here we can put things like copyright
information

43
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,790
or social media links, similar to the
header,

44
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:33,590
this is a good place to put information
that we want to feature on every page.

45
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,790
Unlike the header, this information isn't
really important enough to put at the

46
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,590
top of the page, so we're de-emphasizing
it by putting it at the bottom.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,810
Let's add a paragraph that contains
copyright information.

48
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,930
So, inside of my footer here,

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm going to create a new paragraph and
you'll notice that when I hit enter to

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,930
open up a tag, WorkSpaces automatically
indents for

51
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,290
me, I didn't have to type tab there.

52
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,110
Now, let's create our paragraph, so I'm
going

53
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,780
to type a paragraph element or P tag
there.

54
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,770
And, we're going to use some special code
here,

55
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,750
and I'm gonna type it out, then explain
it.

56
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,350
So, I'm going to type an ampersand, so
I'll hit

57
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,120
Shift and then the number seven on my
keyboard for ampersand.

58
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,180
Then, I'm going to type the word, copy.

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,290
Followed by a semicolon.

60
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,790
And you can see in the code completion

61
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,160
there that WorkSpaces provides, what that
might do.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,820
So, we'll talk about that in a minute.

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,370
Then after my semicolon there, I'm going
to type a space.

64
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm going to type 2014, and I'm going to
type Nick Pettit followed by a period.

65
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,370
This special syntax that we typed is

66
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,050
a character that doesn't appear on our
keyboard.

67
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,410
In fact, it is the copyright character.
So, we need to type what's called

68
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,680
an HTML entity to make it appear.
There are lots

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,020
of HTML entities like this, but there's no
need to memorize them.

70
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,940
Most web designers and developers just go
to a

71
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,030
search engine when they need to look them
up.

72
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,370
In the notes for this video, you'll find a
link that

73
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,780
lists them out for you.
The syntax follows the pattern of an

74
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,330
ampersand followed by the name of the
symbol and then a semi colon.

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,740
So, you can go ahead and type an ampersand
here in WorkSpaces

76
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,960
will automatically generate a list of HTML
entities for you to choose from.

77
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,750
As you can see there are quite a lot of
them but if you

78
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,720
go ahead and continue typing it will
narrow down the list as you type.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,160
But we don't need a second special
character there,

80
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,600
so I'm just going to go ahead and delete
that.

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,570
Now, let's save our webpage and we're
going to preview it.

82
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,440
However, before we open the preview
window, I want you to try and visualize

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,450
what you think the page will look like.
Now, let's open it up.

84
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,520
Does the page look like what you were
expecting?

85
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,100
Right now, it's pretty underwhelming.

86
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,130
It's just a white background and some
black text.

87
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,610
And only the most basic default styling

88
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,100
that's been applied automatically by the
browser.

89
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,080
We're going to add lots more life to this
page

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,810
with CSS, but first, we need to finish up
the content.

91
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,540
One thing I would like you to notice

92
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,300
right now though, is the sequence of the
content.

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,530
From the top down to the bottom, our page
has a header with

94
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,800
our name, followed by a second level
headline that we've made.

95
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,330
Then this section with the content inside

96
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,480
which right now is just a temporary
paragraph.

97
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,620
Followed by the

98
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,210
footer down at the bottom.

99
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,750
This is exactly the same order that our
elements appear in our code.

100
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,500
In other words, we can't just put things
into our HTML randomly.

101
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,460
It should appear in the order that we
would like it to appear on the page.

102
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,890
Starting from the top left corner and
working our way down the page.

103
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,100
We just covered a lot of new HTML
elements, including the doc type, the HTML

104
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,920
element, meta element, title element, head
and body

105
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,180
elements, and the header section and
footer elements.

106
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,990
Before we continue, let's take a quick
code challenge

107
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,770
to make sure that you've mastered this
important information.
