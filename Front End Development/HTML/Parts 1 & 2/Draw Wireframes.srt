1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,540
So far we've just been working with code,
but before we

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,340
move any further we should explore the
design of our website.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,580
Just to serve as a reminder, this is what
our project will look like when it's done.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,430
When you're creating projects on your own
the design won't

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,020
be done for you like it is in this case.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,070
So it's important that we walk through
some

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,420
of the design decisions here and
understand them.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,840
The design process from one site to
another

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,540
will always vary, but for our purposes we
can break things down like this.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,310
First, we're going to decide on goals,
then we'll list out

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,990
the page elements, and finally we'll
layout the pages with shapes.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,010
I'm going to work through the design on

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,420
paper, and I strongly encourage you to
follow along.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,860
First, we should decide on an overall goal
for our site.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,010
In these lessons,

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,960
this website will a design portfolio with
a goal of booking new work.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,370
However, there will be many opportunities
along the way

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,770
for you to customize this website for your
own needs.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,760
For example, your site's goal might be to
showcase your arts and crafts, or perhaps

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,740
you want to create a gallery of photos to
share with your family and friends.

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,520
Once you've decided on your own goal we
should list out the page

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,930
elements we'll need.

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,820
For this website we'll need an image

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,270
gallery, an about page, and a contact
page.

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,358
We'll also need a simple header with a
title and navigation.

26
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:30,970
Often this site-wide header is called top
level navigation.

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,450
We'll also need a site footer.
This image gallery will showcase our work.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,210
The about page will provide some context
for the

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,625
website as a whole and tell the visitor
more information.

30
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:47,850
And then the contact page will give the
visitor a way to get in touch.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,380
This is especially important for a design

32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,920
portfolio where we're trying to get new
work.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,860
With our list in hand, let's quickly lay
out our three page website.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,180
We're going to use a technique called wire
framing to

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,680
lay out the shapes and visual structure of
our site.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,060
This is a much faster way to experiment

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,570
with site layout before you spend lots of
time writing code.

38
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,660
We're also going to design the mobile
version of the

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,270
site and then work our way up to more
complex layouts.

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm going to layout our gallery as a grid
with two images in each row.

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,650
Underneath each image will be a short
caption that gives the image some context.

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,140
This layout

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,170
will allow us enough room to make the

44
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,850
images large so they command a lot of
attention.

45
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,280
Now, let's layout the contact page and
about page.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,770
Both of these pages are pretty simple, so
they can follow the same basic layout.

47
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,740
We'll create a single column and stack
everything, because mobile

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,430
sites don't really have enough room for
too many columns.

49
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,730
But they're great at scrolling.

50
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,310
In the case of our about page,

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,330
we'll add a photo and a paragraph about
ourselves.

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,870
For the contact page, we'll write a
paragraph describing how best to reach us,

53
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,510
along with details like an email address,
phone number and Twitter account.

54
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,200
That's about it for the mobile site.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,960
Now let's take these same pages and make
them work for tablets and desktops.

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,360
We have a lot more width to work with
here,

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,020
so I'm going to spread apart the logo text
and the navigation in the header.

58
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,260
Then on the gallery page, I'm going to

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,840
break up my two columns into three
columns.

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,970
Finally, on our about page and contact
page, I'm going to create two

61
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,510
columns and give our page elements a
little bit more room to breathe.

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,440
Looks good.
Our quick wire frames

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,020
are pretty much done.

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,580
If we were building a more complex website
we might wanna take things

65
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,100
further and build high fidelity mock ups
in an image editing tool like Photoshop.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,500
However, this is a simple website.

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,280
And as we build it in HTML and CSS we can
fill in the details along the way.
