00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,850
In order to understand where we're going,
it helps to take a look back.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,400
Many things in HTML can

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,890
seem counter-intuitive, but walking
through some

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,370
history and foundational knowledge will
provide some context for upcoming lessons.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,940
HTML is an initialism that stands for
hypertext markup language.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,140
It was originally designed to easily share
scientific

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,780
research papers, which is why
professionals typically use terms

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,030
like webpage to describe their creations.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,520
Hyper text basically just means any kind
of

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,300
text that can be displayed on a computer
screen.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,130
But often times, the definition includes
the notion of linked documents.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,440
This is how the web works.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,390
It's a network of information connected
via hyperlinks.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,600
It's worth noting here that this web of

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,910
documents is just one part of the
Internet.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,100
The Internet

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,380
is the global system of computer networks
and hardware on which the web is built.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,110
Now, let's talk about the other part of
HTML.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,050
The term markup language encompasses the
idea of

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,420
computer code that describes the structure
of content.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,530
Imagine that you're creating a newspaper,
and that you need to organize it.

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,340
First, you need to title the newspaper.

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,840
Then you need to add a few sections for
different topics.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Each of those sections needs a large

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,040
headline, followed by a few smaller
headlines.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,940
Then, we need to add a few paragraphs and
photos.

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,800
You'll find that building the structure of
a webpage is very similar.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,970
When you're creating content, you'll need
to use HTML to

30
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,350
break it up into sections, headlines,
paragraphs and so on.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,310
HTML allows us to describe structure but
this is actually a separate

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,620
process from designing its visual
presentation with CSS.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,570
We'll learn more about that later.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,210
By describing the various parts of the
document with markup,

35
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,240
web browsers can parse the structure and
understand its contents.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,760
Some popular web browsers you may have
heard of include Google Chrome, Firefox,

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,320
Safari, or Internet Explorer.
One thing to keep in mind is that

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,760
HTML was not originally designed for

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,010
complex web applications like Facebook or
Twitter.

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,490
Rather, it evolved to serve that purpose.

41
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,800
And, it's only recently that HTML has

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,900
implemented features to serve these more
interactive environments.

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,150
As we continue to learn more, you'll find
that

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,570
web languages are just as flexible as they
are powerful.
