1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,490
With our wire frames in hand, we're ready

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,690
to block out the basic structure of our
website.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,610
Over the last few years, new HTML elements

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,240
have become available along with several
new technologies.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,020
Collectively, these new elements and
technologies are referred to as HTML5.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,190
Now, this might imply a new version of
HTML.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,640
But it's a little bit of a misnomer.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,450
I'm just telling you this now so that

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,870
when you hear other web designers and
developers

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,920
use the term HTML5, you don't get
confused.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,930
All it really means are some new HTML
elements that weren't

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,510
available previously, along with a few new
pieces of browser technology.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,700
Now, let's get coding.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,940
First, let's get rid of these style tags.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,490
I'm going to highlight this entire area
and press

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,300
the Delete key.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,460
We don't need them because we'll add style
later on.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,600
We'll hold on to our headline, because we
will still need it later.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,900
Every web page has to start with what's

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,470
called a document type, or doc type for
short.

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,280
And it looks like this.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
Start out with an opening angle bracket,
an exclamation point.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,570
The word doc type

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,940
in all capital letters, a space, the word
html

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,370
in lower case letters, and then a closing
angle bracket.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,940
There's no closing tag and this tag also

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,740
won't create anything that's visible on
the page.

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,410
There are many other tags like this that
only serve structural purposes and

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,250
are not actually visible to the site
visitor.

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,860
This doc type basically tells the browser
that this is

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,940
an HTML document and that's how it should
be interpreted.

32
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,860
The doc type should always be the first
thing on the page.

33
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,150
And it should always be at the top,
without any space before it.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,200
Now, let's create an HTML element.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,670
Of course, everything that we'll be
creating here is an HTML element.

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:24,000
But this element is actually called HTML.
[SOUND].

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,960
This will serve as the root of our
document structure, and

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,930
similar to the doc type, it won't be
visible to visitors.

39
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,660
I'm going to wrap our headline with the
HTML tags and

40
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,990
then indent it, so that I can easily see
that it's nested.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,290
To do this, I'm going to highlight our h1
element.

42
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:57,280
I'm going to cut it by hitting Cmd+X on a
Mac or Ctrl+X on Windows.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,380
Then I'm going to click inside of our HTML
element,

44
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,310
create some space, then I'm going to paste
it by hitting Cmd+V on

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,621
a Mac or Ctrl+V on Windows.
Then I'm going

46
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:20,000
to go to the beginning of the line and hit
Tab to indent it.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,490
One way you can go quickly from the
beginning to the end of

48
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,170
the line, or vice versa, is by holding
down the Command key and using

49
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,410
the arrows, if you're on a mac, or

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,950
hitting Control and the arrows if you're
on Windows.

51
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,460
So for example, on my Mac here, I can hit
Command

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,790
and right arrow to go to the end of the
line.

53
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,760
Or Command and left arrow to go to the
beginning of the line.

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,970
This handy tip will help you navigate text
more quickly.

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,440
Now we're ready to add two more elements
to our page,

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,160
which are the head element and the body
element.

57
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,560
Both of these need to go inside of our
HTML element.

58
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,700
I'm going to type head and I'm just going
to leave that right above our h1.

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,670
Gonna go to the end of the line and create
a

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,400
new line and then I'm going to type a body
element.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,760
Once again our h1 element needs to go
inside of the body.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,930
And in this case, I'm going to use a new
keyboard shortcut to

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:36,690
actually highlight this body element.
To do this on a Mac, you can hit Cmd+Shift

64
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,010
and then the arrow key depending on the
direction that you want to highlight.

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,965
To do this on Windows, you just hit

66
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:48,300
Ctrl+Shift and then the direction you want
to highlight.

67
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,930
So on my Mac, with my insertion point in
between the two tags,

68
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,391
I'm going to Cmd+Shift and then right
arrow to

69
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:03,280
highlight it, Cmd+X to cut it I'm gonna go
to the

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,220
end of the line here, and paste in that
body tag.

71
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,460
And then I'm going to indent this line
just

72
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,140
like that.
That way I'll know my h1 is nested

73
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,670
inside of my body.
Which is also nested inside of my HTML.

74
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,110
At this point, you're probably starting to
see why indentation is so important.

75
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,170
When you have a much larger HTML file, as
we will later on, it's important to

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:42,130
use indentation so that you can see how
elements are nested inside of one another.

77
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,190
Now let's talk about these two elements
that we

78
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,750
just added.

79
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,740
The head element will contain what's
called meta information, about

80
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,220
our document, which again won't be visible
to site visitors.

81
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,810
However, it will contain important
information like

82
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,560
CSS, which will modify the visuals later
on.

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,870
The head element is not the same thing as
the website header we wire framed earlier.

84
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,690
I know that's a little bit confusing right

85
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,770
now but don't worry, we'll explain the
difference soon.

86
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,500
The body element, which we typed right
here

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,160
will contain the rest of our website
content.

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,980
In other words, this is the body of the
document.

89
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,260
Once again, I've indented my headline
element further

90
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,310
because it's two levels deep here inside
of

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,420
HTML and body.
Now, let's jump inside of the head

92
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,100
and hit Enter, to create some space.
Hit Tab to indent our code.

93
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,310
And then, let's type a title for our
website.

94
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm going to write my name,

95
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,200
followed by a space and a vertical pipe
which

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,050
you can type by hitting Shift and the
backslash key.

97
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,040
Then another space, and I'm going to type
the word designer.

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,980
Because this website is going to be my
design portfolio.

99
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,460
You might wanna put something else, like
photographer or expert

100
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,690
cupcake baker.

101
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,720
The title tag usually appears in browser

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,200
tabs so you know what website you're
visiting.

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,160
It will also appear in search engine
result pages.

104
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,020
Now let's add the character set for the
page just above the title.

105
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,760
That will look like this.
We'll type the word meta followed

106
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,100
by charset, an equals sign and

107
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,130
then two double quotes.
Inside of the double quotes, we're

108
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,256
going to type utf- and the number

109
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:07,890
eight.
And finally, we need to close our Meta

110
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:13,790
tag, this code looks a little bit
intimidating, but don't let it scare you.

111
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,970
It's simply telling the browser how our
webpage

112
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,240
is formatted and what types of characters
are used.

113
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,580
Similar to the DOC type, it's not visible
to the site visitor.

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,660
It also doesn't have a closing tag.

115
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,480
Inside of this meta tag, you'll notice
we've used some new syntax.

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,200
We have a word followed by an equals sign,

117
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,390
which is then followed by a value wrapped
in double quotes.

118
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,670
This is called an attribute.

119
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,800
Attributes are extra information inside of
an HTML tag

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,650
that provides key information to the
browser about how the page is built.

121
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,200
We'll learn more about how to use
attributes on

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,370
many other elements, but for now, let's
focus on what

123
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,730
this attribute means.
The literal translation here is that the

124
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,820
character set or charset should be utf-8,

125
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,740
or universal character set transformation
format, eight bit.

126
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,760
Don't worry about memorizing that.

127
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,450
In fact, I even had to look it up

128
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,640
and I've been making websites for more
than a decade.

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,170
Again, it just describes how our page is
formatted.
