1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,370
We're ready to upload our website to our
server.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,840
In order to do that, we'll need some
special

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,740
software that can use what's called the
SFTP protocol.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,030
SFTP can mean a few things.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,460
But often, it stands for secure file
transfer protocol.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,780
In other words, we're going to be

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,860
transferring our files using a secure
connection.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,400
After we pointed our domain to our server

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,740
we should be able to navigate to our
domain in

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,890
a web browser and it should look something
like this.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,590
So if I type in treehousewebsite.com,
which is the domain I purchased.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,670
We can see this Index of text, a

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,700
CGI bin folder and some information about
the server.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,380
We want to replace this with our website
that we spent so long creating.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,640
So, let's get started.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,900
In order to do that,

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,150
we need to first download some FTP

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,070
software to transfer our files to the
server.

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm going to use FTP software called
Cyberduck, available at Cyberduck.io.

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,640
You can also download it from the Mac App
Store,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,410
but there are download links here for
Windows and for Mac.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,620
So be sure to choose the download link
appropriate for your operating system.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,990
I'm going

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,590
to choose the Mac download, and this might
be a good time

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,480
to pause the video while you wait for the
download to finish.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,580
And after it's done, I can choose Show in
Finder.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,190
Which should be Windows Explorer, if
you're on Windows.

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,630
I can then double-click the zip file and
it will unzip CyberDuck.

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,420
And now, I can drag it to my Applications
folder.

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,420
Again, this installation process will be
slightly different

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,390
on Windows, but it should be the same
principle.

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,510
Once you've installed CyberDuck, you can
open it up.

33
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,070
And if you're on a Mac like me, you might
see a

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,740
window that looks like this, asking if you
really wanna open it.

35
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,760
Just go ahead and click Open.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,060
And the first time you open Cyberduck it
should look something like this.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,070
Your bookmarks

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,040
might be slightly different than mine but
that's okay.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,160
Just click Open Connection and then we
need to put in our SFTP credentials.

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,120
So instead of file transfer protocol,
choose SFTP from the drop down.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,930
Which means SSH file transfer protocol,
which is sometimes also called

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,330
secure file transfer protocol because
indeed it is more secure than FTP.

43
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,860
So choose SFTP and then it will ask us to
put in a server.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,470
If you recall, we received an email
earlier from student hosting with the

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,650
FTP address, as well as our username, and
just below this is my password.

46
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,080
But I don't want to reveal my password,
for obvious reasons, you

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,400
should use your own username and password
as well as your own domain.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,830
So

49
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm going to put in my FTP address, which
in this case

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,037
happens to be my domain.
Then I need to fill in the port number.

51
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:16,097
In this case, the port number is 18765.

52
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:21,620
Again, that's 18765.
Then type in your username.

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,620
My username is treehous without the e,

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,560
because the server abbreviates it to eight
characters in this particular case.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,000
And then I'm going to put in my password,
and then I'll click Connect.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,580
You might see a dialogue box that looks
like this.

57
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,120
It says, unknown host key for your domain.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,630
That's perfectly fine, we want to allow
this,

59
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,250
and you might want to check always allow
this.

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,640
And when you first log into your server it
should

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
look something like this.

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,450
We want to navigate to the www folder
because that's

63
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,490
where our website will live on the World
Wide Web.

64
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,300
Let's double click that folder, and here's

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,020
that CGI bin folder that we saw
previously.

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,330
We don't need this folder for our project,
so right click on it and choose delete.

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,180
And then click delete to confirm.

68
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,660
And now, we need to upload our files to
this window here.

69
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,740
How do we do that?

70
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,000
Well let's go back to our work space and
from here we can

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,230
choose File > Download Workspace.
And it

72
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,500
will download it to a zip file I can show
this in the Finder.

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,500
Double click it to unzip it and when you
unzip

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,180
the file, it should give you a folder
called download.

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,130
We don't want to just copy this download
folder directly to CyberDuck.

76
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,660
Rather we want to open it up and only copy
its contents.

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,200
So don't just drag this over to CyberDuck.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Make sure you grab the contents of the
download folder.

79
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,880
And then you can drag and drop it over to
CyberDuck.

80
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,670
So I'll drag the contents of the Download
folder over to my WWW folder in CyberDuck.

81
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,680
Again I need to click Allow for the host
key fingerprint, and then it

82
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,900
will log in and start uploading my files.
Once the upload has completed,

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,960
I can click on my website, refresh the
page, and as

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,880
you can see our site is now live on the
web.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,210
I can click on these images and they'll
enlarge just like you'd expect.

86
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,440
And I can also click around to the
different

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,500
pages and they're also there just as you'd
expect.

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,160
So now anyone in the world can type in
your custom domain and see your website.

89
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,680
Our website is now live on the web and
anyone with an

90
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,970
internet connection can type the address
into a browser and access it.

91
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,810
There's still a few more things you should
know about making basic

92
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,730
website before we move on to a more
advanced material.

93
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,020
But we'll cover that next.
